=== Installing the Server

The {project_name} Server is contained in one distribution file:

* 'rh-sso-{project_version}.GA.zip'

NOTE: This file can be downloaded in the Red Hat customer portal
https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?downloadType=distributions&product=core.service.rhsso[Downloads].

The 'rh-sso-{project_version}.GA.zip' file is the server-only distribution. It contains only the scripts and binaries
to run the {project_name} server.

To unpack these files run the `unzip` or `gunzip` utilities.
