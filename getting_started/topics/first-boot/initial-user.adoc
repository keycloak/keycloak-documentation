=== Creating the Admin Account

After the server boots, open http://localhost:8080/auth in your web browser. The welcome page will indicate that the server is running.

Enter a username and password to create an initial admin user. 

This account will be permitted to log in to the `master` realm's administration console, from which you will create realms and users and register applications to be secured by {project_name}.

NOTE:  You can only create an initial admin user on the Welcome Page if you connect using `localhost`. This is a security
       precaution. You can create the initial admin user at the command line with the `add-user-keycloak.sh` script. For more information, see the
       link:{installguide_link}[{installguide_name}] and the link:{adminguide_link}[{adminguide_name}].
