. Your client application entry will be created after you click the `Save` button. You now have to go back to the {appserver_name} instance that the application is deployed on and configure it so that this app is secured by {project_name}. You can obtain a template for the configuration you need by going to the `Installation` tab in the client entry in the {project_name} Admin Console.
