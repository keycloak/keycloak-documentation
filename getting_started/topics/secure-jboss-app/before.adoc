=== Before You Start

Before you can secure a Java servlet application, you must complete the installation of {project_name} and create the initial admin user as shown in  <<_install-boot, Installing and Booting>>.

There is one caveat: Even though {appserver_name} is bundled with keycloak, you cannot use this as an application container.  Instead, you must run a separate {appserver_name} instance on the same machine as the {project_name} server to run your Java servlet application. Run the {project_name} using a different port than the {appserver_name}, to avoid port conflicts.

To adjust the port used, change the value of the `jboss.socket.binding.port-offset` system property when starting the server from the command line. The value of this property is a number that will be added to the base value of every port opened by the {project_name} server.

To start the {project_name} server while also adjusting the port:

.Linux/Unix
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ cd bin
$ ./standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

.Windows
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
> ...\bin\standalone.bat -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

After starting {project_name}, go to http://localhost:8180/auth/admin/ to access the admin console.
