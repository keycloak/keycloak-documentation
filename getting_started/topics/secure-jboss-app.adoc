== Securing a sample application

Now that you have an admin account, a realm, and a user, you can use {project_name} to secure a sample {appserver_name} servlet application. You install a {appserver_name} client adapter, register the application in the admin console, modify the {appserver_name} instance to work with {project_name}, and use {project_name} with some sample code to secure the application.

.Prerequisites

* You need to adjust the port used by {project_name} to avoid port conflicts with {appserver_name}.
