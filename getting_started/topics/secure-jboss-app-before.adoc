= Before You Start

Before you can participate in this tutorial, you need to complete the installation of {project_name} and create the
initial admin user as shown in the <<_install-boot, Installing and Booting>> tutorial.  There is one
caveat to this.  You have to run a separate {appserver_name} instance on the same machine as the
{project_name} server.  This separate instance will run your Java Servlet application.  Because of this you will
have to run the {project_name} under a different port so that there are no port conflicts when running on the
same machine.  Use the `jboss.socket.binding.port-offset` system property on the command line.  The value of this property
is a number that will be added to the base value of every port opened by the {project_name} server.

To boot the {project_name} server:

.Linux/Unix
[source]
----
$ .../bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

.Windows
[source]
----
> ...\bin\standalone.bat -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

After booting up {project_name}, you can then access the admin console at http://localhost:8180/auth/admin/
