Alternatively you can go to the console URL directly at http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/

NOTE:  If you are curious about a certain feature, button, or field within the Admin Console, hover your mouse
      over the question mark `?` icon.  This will pop up tooltip text to describe the area of the console you are interested in.
      The image above shows the tooltip in action.
