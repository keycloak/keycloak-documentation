=== Creating a New Realm

To create a new realm, complete the following steps:

. Go to http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/ and log in to the {project_name} Admin Console using the account you created in <<_install-boot, Install and Boot>>.

. From the *Master* drop-down menu, click *Add Realm*. When you are logged in to the master realm this drop-down menu lists all existing realms.

. Type `demo` in the *Name* field and click *Create*.

When the realm is created, the main admin console page opens. Notice the current realm is now set to `demo`. Switch between managing the `master` realm and the realm you just created by clicking entries in the *Select realm* drop-down menu.
