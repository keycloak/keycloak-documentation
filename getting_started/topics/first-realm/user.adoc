=== Creating a New User

To create a new user in the `demo` realm, along with a temporary password for that new user, complete the following steps:

. From the menu, click *Users* to open the user list page.

. On the right side of the empty user list, click *Add User* to open the add user page.

. Enter a name in the `Username` field; this is the only required field. Flip the *Email Verified* switch from *Off* to *On* and click *Save* to save the data and open the management page for the new user.

. Click the *Credentials* tab to set a temporary password for the new user.

. Type a new password and confirm it. Click *Set Password* to set the user password.  

NOTE: This password is temporary and the user will be required to change it after the first login. To create a password that is persistent, flip the *Temporary* switch from *On* to *Off* before clicking *Set Password*.
