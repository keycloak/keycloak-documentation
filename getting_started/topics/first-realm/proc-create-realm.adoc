As the admin in the master realm, you create the realms where administrators create users and applications.

.Prerequisites

* {project_name} is installed.
* You have the initial admin account for the admin console.

.Procedure

. Go to http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/ and log in to the {project_name} admin console using the admin account.

. From the *Master* menu, click *Add Realm*. When you are logged in to the master realm, this menu lists all other realms.

. Type `demo` in the *Name* field.
