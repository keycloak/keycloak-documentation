=== Realms and users
When you log in to the admin console, you work in a realm, which is a space where you manage objects. Two types of realms exist:

* `Master realm` - This realm was created for you when you first started {project_name}. It contains the admin account you created at the first login. You use this realm only to create other realms.

* `Other realms` - These realms are created by the admin in the master realm. In these realms, administrators create users and applications. The applications are owned by the users.
