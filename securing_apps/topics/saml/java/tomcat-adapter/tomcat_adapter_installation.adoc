===== Adapter Installation

Adapters are no longer included with the appliance or war distribution.
Each adapter is a separate download on the Keycloak download site.
They are also available as a maven artifact. 

You must unzip the adapter distro into Tomcat's `lib/` directory.
Including adapter's jars within your WEB-INF/lib directory will not work!  The Keycloak SAML adapter is implemented as
a Valve and valve code must reside in Tomcat's main lib/ directory.
