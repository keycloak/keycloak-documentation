<SingleSignOnService signRequest="true"
                     validateResponseSignature="true"
                     requestBinding="post"
                     bindingUrl="url"/>

Here are the config attributes you can define on this element:

signRequest::
  Should the client sign authn requests? This setting is _OPTIONAL_.
  Defaults to whatever the IDP `signaturesRequired` element value is. 

validateResponseSignature::
  Should the client expect the IDP to sign the assertion response document sent back from an auhtn request?
  This setting _OPTIONAL_. Defaults to whatever the IDP `signaturesRequired` element value is.

requestBinding::
  This is the SAML binding type used for communicating with the IDP.  This setting is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is `POST`, but you can set it to `REDIRECT` as well.

responseBinding::
  SAML allows the client to request what binding type it wants authn responses to use.
  The values of this can be `POST` or `REDIRECT`.  This setting is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default is that the client will not request a specific binding type for responses. 

assertionConsumerServiceUrl::
  URL of the assertion consumer service (ACS) where the IDP login service should send responses to.
  This setting is _OPTIONAL_. By default it is unset, relying on the configuration in the IdP.
  When set, it must end in `/saml`, e.g. `\http://sp.domain.com/my/endpoint/for/saml`. The value
  of this property is sent in `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute of SAML `AuthnRequest` message.
  This property is typically  accompanied by the `responseBinding` attribute.

bindingUrl::
  This is the URL for the IDP login service that the client will send requests to. This setting is _REQUIRED_.
