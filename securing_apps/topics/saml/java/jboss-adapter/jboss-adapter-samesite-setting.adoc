===== Setting SameSite value for JSESSIONID cookie

Browsers are planning to set the default value for the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to `Lax`. This setting means
that cookies will be sent to applications only if the request originates in the same domain. This behavior can affect
the SAML POST binding which may become non-functional. To preserve full functionality of the SAML adapter, we recommend
setting the `SameSite` value to `None` for the `JSESSIONID` cookie created by your container. Not doing so may result in
resetting the container's session with each request to {project_name}.

NOTE: To avoid setting the `SameSite` attribute to `None`, consider switching to the REDIRECT binding
if it is acceptable, or to OIDC protocol where this workaround is not necessary.

To set the `SameSite` value to `None` for the `JSESSIONID` cookie in Wildfly/EAP, add a file `undertow-handlers.conf`
with the following content to the `WEB-INF` directory of your application.

 samesite-cookie(mode=None, cookie-pattern=JSESSIONID)

The support for this configuration is available in Wildfly from version 19.1.0.
