===== Securing Fuse Administration Services

====== Using SSH Authentication to Fuse Terminal

{project_name} mainly addresses use cases for authentication of web applications; however, if your other web services and applications are protected
with {project_name}, protecting non-web administration services such as SSH with {project_name} credentials is a best pracrice. You can do this using the JAAS login module, which allows remote connection to {project_name} and verifies credentials based on
<<_resource_owner_password_credentials_flow,Resource Owner Password Credentials>>.

To enable SSH authentication, complete the following steps:

. In  {project_name} create a client (for example, `ssh-jmx-admin-client`), which will be used for SSH authentication.
This client needs to have `Direct Access Grants Enabled` selected to `On`.

. In the `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg` file, update or specify this property:
+
[source]
----
sshRealm=keycloak
----

. Add the `$FUSE_HOME/etc/keycloak-direct-access.json` file with content similar to the following (based on your environment and {project_name} client settings):
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "realm": "demo",
    "resource": "ssh-jmx-admin-client",
    "ssl-required" : "external",
    "auth-server-url" : "http://localhost:8080/auth",
    "credentials": {
        "secret": "password"
    }
}
----
This file specifies the client application configuration, which is used by JAAS DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule from the `keycloak` JAAS realm for SSH authentication.

. Start Fuse and install the `keycloak` JAAS realm. The easiest way is to install the `keycloak-jaas` feature, which has the JAAS realm predefined. You can override the feature's predefined realm by using your own `keycloak` JAAS realm with higher ranking. For details see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html-single/security_guide/#ESBSecureContainer[JBoss Fuse documentation]. 
+
Use these commands in the Fuse terminal:
+
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
features:addurl mvn:org.keycloak/keycloak-osgi-features/{project_versionMvn}/xml/features
features:install keycloak-jaas
----

. Log in using SSH as `admin` user by typing the following in the terminal:
+
```
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -p 8101 admin@localhost
```

. Log in with password `password`.

NOTE: On some later operating systems, you might also need to use the SSH command's -o option `-o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss` because later SSH clients do not allow use of the `ssh-dss` algorithm, by default. However, by default, it is currently used in {fuseVersion}.

Note that the user needs to have realm role `admin` to perform all operations or another role to perform a subset of operations (for example, the *viewer* role that restricts the user to run only read-only Karaf commands). The available roles are configured in `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg` or `$FUSE_HOME/etc/system.properties`.

====== Using JMX Authentication

JMX authentication might be necessary if you want to use jconsole or another external tool to remotely connect to JMX through RMI. Otherwise it might be better to use hawt.io/jolokia, since the jolokia agent is installed in hawt.io by default. For more details see <<_hawtio,Hawtio Admin Console>>.

To use JMX authentication, complete the following steps:

. In the `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.management.cfg` file, change the jmxRealm property to:
+
[source]
----
jmxRealm=keycloak
----

. Install the `keycloak-jaas` feature and configure the `$FUSE_HOME/etc/keycloak-direct-access.json` file as described in the SSH section above.

. In jconsole you can use a URL such as:

[source]
----
service:jmx:rmi://localhost:44444/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-root
----

and credentials: admin/password (based on the user with admin privileges according to your environment).
