===== Securing Your Web Applications Inside Fuse

You must first install the {project_name} Karaf feature. Next you will need to perform the steps according to the type of application you want to secure.
All referenced web applications require injecting the {project_name} Jetty authenticator into the underlying Jetty server. The steps to achieve this depend on the application type. The details are described below.

The best place to start is look at Fuse demo bundled as part of {project_name} examples in directory `fuse` . Most of the steps should be understandable from testing and
understanding the demo.
