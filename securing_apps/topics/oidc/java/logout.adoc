==== Logout

You can log out of a web application in multiple ways.
For Java EE servlet containers, you can call HttpServletRequest.logout(). For other browser applications, you can redirect the browser to
`$$http://auth-server/auth/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/logout?redirect_uri=encodedRedirectUri$$`, which logs you out if you have an SSO session with your browser.

If you want to avoid logging out of an external identity provider as part of the logout process, you can supply the parameter `$$initiating_idp$$`, with the value being
the identity (alias) of the identity provider in question. This is useful when the logout endpoint is invoked as part of single logout initiated by the external identity provider.
