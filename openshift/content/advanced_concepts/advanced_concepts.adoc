These cover additional configuration topics, such as seting up keystores and a truststore for the RH-SSO server, creating an administrator account, an overview of available RH-SSO client registration methods, and guidance on configuring clustering.

=== Requirements and Deploying xref:../introduction/introduction.adoc#passthrough-templates[Passthrough TLS Termination] RH-SSO Templates

==== Preparing the Deployment
Log in to the OpenShift CLI with a user that holds the _cluster:admin_ role.

. Create a new project:
+
----
$ oc new-project sso-app-demo
----
. Add the `view` role to the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/service_accounts.html#default-service-accounts-and-roles[`default`] service account. This enables the service account to view all the resources in the sso-app-demo namespace, which is necessary for managing the cluster.

[[Configuring-Keystores]]
==== Creating HTTPS and JGroups Keystores, and Truststore for the RH-SSO Server

The RH-SSO application templates using xref:../introduction/introduction.adoc#passthrough-templates[passthrough TLS termination] require:

* An xref:create-https-keystore[HTTPS keystore] used for encryption of https traffic,
* The xref:create-jgroups-keystore[JGroups keystore] used for encryption of JGroups communications between nodes in the cluster, and
* xref:create-server-truststore[RH-SSO server truststore] used for securing the RH-SSO requests

the {productname} image to be deployed properly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The RH-SSO application templates using xref:../introduction/introduction.adoc#reencrypt-templates[re-encryption TLS termination] do not *require* or *expect* the aforementioned HTTPS and JGroups keystores and RH-SSO server truststore to be prepared beforehand. The templates use OpenShift's internal link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/secrets.html#service-serving-certificate-secrets[service serving x509 certificate secrets] to automatically create the HTTPS and JGroups keystores. The RH-SSO server truststore is also created automatically, containing the */var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt* CA certificate file, which is used to create these cluster certificates. Moreover, the truststore for the RH-SSO server is pre-populated with the all known, trusted CA certificate files found in the Java system path.
====

The *_openssl_* toolkit is used in the following example to generate a CA certificate to sign the HTTPS keystore, and create a truststore for the RH-SSO server. *_keytool_*, a package *included with the Java Development Kit*, is then utilized to the generate self-signed certificates for these keystores.

[WARNING]
====
For production environments Red Hat recommends that you use your own SSL certificate purchased from a verified Certificate Authority (CA) for SSL-encrypted connections (HTTPS).

See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/jboss_enterprise_application_platform/6.1/html-single/security_guide/index#Generate_a_SSL_Encryption_Key_and_Certificate[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Security Guide] for more information on how to create a keystore with self-signed or purchased SSL certificates.

==== Secrets

OpenShift uses objects called link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] to hold sensitive information, such as passwords or keystores.

. Create the secrets for the HTTPS and JGroups keystores, and RH-SSO server truststore, generated in the xref:Configuring-Keystores[previous section].
+
----
$ oc secret new sso-app-secret keystore.jks jgroups.jceks truststore.jks
----

----
$ oc secrets link default sso-app-secret
----

==== Deploying the Chosen RH-SSO Passthrough TLS Template via OpenShift CLI

After the aforementioned xref:Configuring-Keystores[keystores] and xref:Configuring-Secrets[secrets] are created, deploy some of the available xref:../introduction/introduction.adoc#passthrough-templates[passthrough TLS termination] as follows:

[WARNING]
====
For simplicity, the values of *_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_*, *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_*, *_HTTPS_PASSWORD_*, *_JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD_*, and *_SSO_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD_* variables xref:advanced-topics-deploy-sso72-https-template[in the following command] have been chosen to match the default values of the respective parameters of the *_sso72-https_* RH-SSO application template.

For production environments, Red Hat recommends that you consult the on-site policy, specific to your organization for guidance on how to generate sufficiently strong user name and password for the administrator user account of the RH-SSO server, and passwords for the HTTPS and JGroups keystores, and the truststore of the RH-SSO server.

Be aware that *the passwords provided when provisioning the template need to match the passwords provided when creating the keystores*. If using different username and passwords, modify the values of respective xref:advanced-topics-deploy-sso72-https-template[template parameters] as appropriate for your environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
The following commands using the *_keytool_*, a package *included with the Java Development Kit*, can be used to determine the names associated with the certificate:

----
$ keytool -v -list -keystore keystore.jks | grep Alias
Enter keystore password:  mykeystorepass
Alias name: xpaas.ca
Alias name: jboss
----

----
$ keytool -v -list -keystore jgroups.jceks -storetype jceks | grep Alias
Enter keystore password:  password
Alias name: secret-key
----

Finally, the *_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_*, *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_*, and the *_SSO_REALM_* template parameters in the following command are optional.
====

==== Accessing the Administrator Console of the RH-SSO Pod

After the template got deployed, identify the available routes:

----
$ oc get routes
----

[cols="7",options="header"]
|===
|NAME |HOST/PORT |PATH |SERVICES |PORT |TERMINATION |WILDCARD

|secure-sso
|secure-sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com
|

|<all>
|passthrough
|None

|sso
|sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com
|
|sso
|<all>
|
|None
|===

and access the RH-SSO administrator console at:

* *\https://secure-sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com/auth/admin*
* *\http://sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com/auth/admin*

using the xref:../advanced_concepts/advanced_concepts.adoc#sso-administrator-setup[administrator account].

[[sso-administrator-setup]]
=== Creating Administrator Account for Red Hat Single Sign-On Server

Red Hat Single Sign-On does not provide any pre-configured management account out of the box. This administrator account is necessary for logging into the `master` realm's management console and perform server maintenance operations such as, creating realms or users, or registering applications intended to be secured by Red Hat Single Sign-On.

The administrator account can be created:

* By providing values for the xref:sso-admin-template-parameters[*_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_* and *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_* parameters], when deploying the RH-SSO application template, or
* By xref:sso-admin-remote-shell[a remote shell session to particular RH-SSO pod], if the {productname} image is deployed without an application template.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Single Sign-On allows an initial administrator account to be created via the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html-single/getting_started_guide/#creating_the_admin_account[Welcome Page] web form, but only if the Welcome Page is accessed from localhost; this method of administrator account creation is not applicable for the {productname} image.
====

[[sso-admin-template-parameters]]
==== Creating RH-SSO Administrator Account via Template Parameters

When deploying RH-SSO application template, *_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_* and *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_* parameters denote the username and password of the RH-SSO server's administrator account to be created for the `master` realm.

[NOTE]
====
*Both of these parameters are required.* If not specified, they are auto generated and displayed as an OpenShift instructional message when the template is instantiated.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The lifespan of the RH-SSO server's administrator account depends upon the the storage type used to store the RH-SSO server's database:

* For an in-memory database mode (*_sso72-https_* and *_sso72-x509-https_* templates) the account exists throughout the lifecycle of the particular RH-SSO pod (stored account data is lost upon pod destruction),
* For an ephemeral database mode (*_sso72-mysql_* and *_sso72-postgresql_* templates) the account exists throughout the lifecycle of the database pod (even if the RH-SSO pod is destructed, the stored account data is preserved under the assumption that the database pod is still running),
* For persistent database mode (*_sso72-mysql-persistent_*, *_sso72-x509-mysql-persistent_*, *_sso72-postgresql-persistent_*, and *_sso72-x509-postgresql-persistent_* templates) the account exists throughout the lifecycle of the persistent medium used to hold the database data. This means that the stored account data is preserved even when both the RH-SSO and the database pods are destructed.

It is a common practice to deploy an RH-SSO application template to get the corresponding OpenShift deployment config for the application, and then reuse that deployment config multiple times (every time a new RH-SSO application needs to be instantiated).
====

[WARNING]
====
In the case of *ephemeral or persistent database mode*, after creating the RH_SSO server's administrator account, remove the *_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_* and *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_* variables from the deployment config before deploying new RH-SSO applications.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Run the following commands to prepare the previously created deployment config of the RH-SSO application for reuse after the administrator account has been created:

. Identify the deployment config of the RH-SSO application.
+
----
$ oc get dc -o name
deploymentconfig/sso
deploymentconfig/sso-mysql
----
. Clear the *_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_* and *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_* variables setting.
+
----
$ oc env dc/sso -e SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME="" SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=""
----
====

[[sso-admin-remote-shell]]
==== Creating RH-SSO Administrator Account via Remote Shell Session to RH-SSO Pod

Run following commands to create an administrator account for the `master` realm of the RH-SSO server, when deploying the {productname} image directly from the image stream (without the xref:../introduction/introduction.adoc#sso-templates[template]), after the RH-SSO application pod has been started:

. Identify the RH-SSO application pod.
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sso-12-pt93n        1/1       Running   0          1m
sso-mysql-6-d97pf   1/1       Running   0          2m
----
. Open a remote shell session to the {productname} container.
+
----
$ oc rsh sso-12-pt93n
sh-4.2$
----
. Create the RH-SSO server administrator account for the `master` realm at the command line with the `add-user-keycloak.sh` script.
+
----
sh-4.2$ cd /opt/eap/bin/
sh-4.2$ ./add-user-keycloak.sh -r master -u sso_admin -p sso_password
Added 'sso_admin' to '/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/keycloak-add-user.json', restart server to load user
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `sso_admin`/`sso_password` credentials in the example above are for demonstration purposes only. Refer to the password policy applicable within your organization for guidance on how to create a secure user name and password.
====
. Restart the underlying JBoss EAP server instance to load the newly added user account. Wait for the server to restart properly.
+
----
sh-4.2$ ./jboss-cli.sh --connect ':reload'
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => undefined
}
----
+
[WARNING]
====
When restarting the server it is important to restart just the JBoss EAP process within the running RH-SSO container, and not the whole container. This is because restarting the whole container will recreate it from scratch, without the RH-SSO server administration account for the `master` realm.
====
. Log in to the `master` realm's administration console of the RH-SSO server using the the credentials created in the steps above. In the browser, navigate to *\http://sso-<project-name>.<hostname>/auth/admin*  for the RH-SSO web server, or to *\https://secure-sso-<project-name>.<hostname>/auth/admin* for the encrypted RH-SSO web server, and specify the user name and password used to create the administrator user.

=== Deployment Process

Once deployed, the *_sso72-https_* and *_sso72-x509-https_* templates create a single pod that contains both the database and the RH-SSO servers. The *_sso72-mysql_*, *_sso72-mysql-persistent_*, *_sso72-x509-mysql-persistent_*, *_sso72-postgresql_*, *_sso72-postgresql-persistent_*, and *_sso72-x509-postgresql-persistent_* templates create two pods, one for the database server and one for the RH-SSO web server.

After the RH-SSO web server pod has started, it can be accessed from its custom configured hostnames, or from the default hostnames:

* *\http://sso-_<project-name>_._<hostname>_/auth/admin*: for the RH-SSO web server, and
* *\https://secure-sso-_<project-name>_._<hostname>_/auth/admin*: for the encrypted RH-SSO web server.

Use the xref:../advanced_concepts/advanced_concepts.adoc#sso-administrator-setup[administrator user credentials] to log in into the `master` realm’s administration console.

[[SSO-Clients]]
=== RH-SSO Clients

Clients are RH-SSO entities that request user authentication. A client can be an application requesting RH-SSO to provide user authentication, or it can make requests for access tokens to start services on behalf of an authenticated user. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html/server_administration_guide/clients[Managing Clients chapter of the Red Hat Single Sign-On documentation] for more information.

RH-SSO provides link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html/server_administration_guide/clients#oidc_clients[OpenID-Connect] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html/server_administration_guide/clients#saml_clients[SAML] client protocols. +
OpenID-Connect is the preferred protocol and utilizes three different access types:

- *public*: Useful for JavaScript applications that run directly in the browser and require no server configuration.
- *confidential*: Useful for server-side clients, such as EAP web applications, that need to perform a browser login.
- *bearer-only*: Useful for back-end services that allow bearer token requests.

It is required to specify the client type in the *<auth-method>* key of the application *web.xml* file. This file is read by the image at deployment. Set the value of *<auth-method>* element to:

* *KEYCLOAK* for the OpenID Connect client.
* *KEYCLOAK-SAML* for the SAML client.

The following is an example snippet for the application *web.xml* to configure an OIDC client:

----
...
<login-config>
        <auth-method>KEYCLOAK</auth-method>
</login-config>
...
----

[[Auto-Man-Client-Reg]]
==== Automatic and Manual RH-SSO Client Registration Methods
A client application can be automatically registered to an RH-SSO realm by using credentials passed in variables specific to the *_eap64-sso-s2i_*,  *_eap70-sso-s2i_*, *_eap71-sso-s2i_*, and *_datavirt63-secure-s2i_* templates.

Alternatively, you can manually register the client application by configuring and exporting the RH-SSO client adapter and including it in the client application configuration.

===== Automatic RH-SSO Client Registration

Automatic RH-SSO client registration is determined by RH-SSO environment variables specific to the *_eap64-sso-s2i_*,  *_eap70-sso-s2i_*, *_eap71-sso-s2i_*, and *_datavirt63-secure-s2i_* templates. The RH-SSO credentials supplied in the template are then used to register the client to the RH-SSO realm during deployment of the client application.

The RH-SSO environment variables included in the *_eap64-sso-s2i_*,  *_eap70-sso-s2i_*, *_eap71-sso-s2i_*, and *_datavirt63-secure-s2i_* templates are:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Variable
|Description
|*_HOSTNAME_HTTP_*
|Custom hostname for http service route. Leave blank for default hostname of <application-name>.<project>.<default-domain-suffix>

|*_HOSTNAME_HTTPS_*
|Custom hostname for https service route. Leave blank for default hostname of <application-name>.<project>.<default-domain-suffix>

|*_SSO_URL_*
|The RH-SSO web server authentication address: $$https://secure-sso-$$_<project-name>_._<hostname>_/auth

|*_SSO_REALM_*
|The RH-SSO realm created for this procedure.

|*_SSO_USERNAME_*
|The name of the _realm management user_.

|*_SSO_PASSWORD_*
| The password of the user.

|*_SSO_PUBLIC_KEY_*
|The public key generated by the realm. It is located in the *Keys* tab of the *Realm Settings* in the RH-SSO console.

|*_SSO_BEARER_ONLY_*
|If set to *true*, the OpenID Connect client is registered as bearer-only.

|*_SSO_ENABLE_CORS_*
|If set to *true*, the RH-SSO adapter enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
|===

If the RH-SSO client uses the SAML protocol, the following additional variables need to be configured:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Variable
|Description
|*_SSO_SAML_KEYSTORE_SECRET_*
|Secret to use for access to SAML keystore. The default is _sso-app-secret_.

|*_SSO_SAML_KEYSTORE_*
|Keystore filename in the SAML keystore secret. The default is _keystore.jks_.

|*_SSO_SAML_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_*
|Keystore password for SAML. The default is _mykeystorepass_.

|*_SSO_SAML_CERTIFICATE_NAME_*
|Alias for keys/certificate to use for SAML. The default is _jboss_.
|===

See xref:Example-EAP-Auto[Example Workflow: Automatically Registering EAP Application in RH-SSO with OpenID-Connect Client] for an end-to-end example of the automatic client registration method using an OpenID-Connect client.

===== Manual RH-SSO Client Registration

Manual RH-SSO client registration is determined by the presence of a deployment file in the client application's _../configuration/_ directory. These files are exported from the client adapter in the RH-SSO web console. The name of this file is different for OpenID-Connect and SAML clients:

[horizontal]
*OpenID-Connect*:: _../configuration/secure-deployments_
*SAML*:: _../configuration/secure-saml-deployments_

These files are copied to the RH-SSO adapter configuration section in the _standalone-openshift.xml_ at when the application is deployed.

There are two methods for passing the RH-SSO adapter configuration to the client application:

* Modify the deployment file to contain the RH-SSO adapter configuration so that it is included in the _standalone-openshift.xml_ file at deployment, or
* Manually include the OpenID-Connect _keycloak.json_ file, or the SAML _keycloak-saml.xml_ file in the client application's *../WEB-INF* directory.

See xref:Example-EAP-Manual[Example Workflow: Manually Configure an Application to Use RH-SSO Authentication, Using SAML Client] for an end-to-end example of the manual RH-SSO client registration method using a SAML client.

=== Limitations
OpenShift does not currently accept OpenShift role mapping from external providers. If RH-SSO is used as an authentication gateway for OpenShift, users created in RH-SSO must have the roles added using the OpenShift Administrator `oadm policy` command.

For example, to allow an RH-SSO-created user to view a project namespace in OpenShift:
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
oadm policy add-role-to-user view <pass:quotes[_user-name_]> -n <pass:quotes[_project-name_]>
----
