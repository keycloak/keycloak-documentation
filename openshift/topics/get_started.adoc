====
Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift images are pulled on demand from the secured Red Hat Registry: link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/[registry.redhat.io], which requires authentication. To retrieve content, you will need to log into the registry using the Red Hat account.

To consume container images from *_registry.redhat.io_* in shared environments such as OpenShift, it is recommended for an administrator to use a Registry Service Account, also referred to as authentication tokens, in place of an individual person's Red Hat Customer Portal credentials.

To create a Registry Service Account, navigate to the link:https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Registry Service Account Management Application], and log in if necessary.

. From the *_Registry Service Accounts_* page, click *_Create Service Account_*.
. Provide a name for the Service Account, for example *_registry.redhat.io-sa_*. It will be prepended with a fixed, random string.
.. Enter a description for the Service Account, for example *_Service account to consume container images from registry.redhat.io._*.
.. Click *_Create_*.
. After the Service Account was created, click the *_registry.redhat.io-sa_* link in the *_Account name_* column of the table presented on the *_Registry Service Accounts_* page.
. Finally, click the *_OpenShift Secret_* tab, and perform all steps listed on that page.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication] article for more information.

. Ensure that you are logged in as a cluster administrator or a user with project administrator access to the global openshift project:

. Choose a command based on your version of OpenShift Container Platform.

.. If you are running an OpenShift Container Platform v3 based cluster instance on (some) of your master host(s), perform the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
----
.. If you are running an OpenShift Container Platform v4 based cluster instance, link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-logging-in_cli-developer-commands[log in to the CLI] as the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/remove-kubeadmin.html#understanding-kubeadmin_removing-kubeadmin[kubeadmin] user:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p password \https://openshift.example.com:6443
----
  
. Run the following commands to update the core set of {project_name} {project_version} resources for OpenShift in the `openshift` project:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ for resource in {project_templates_version}-image-stream.json \
  {project_templates_version}-https.json \
  {project_templates_version}-postgresql.json \
  {project_templates_version}-postgresql-persistent.json \
  {project_templates_version}-x509-https.json \
  {project_templates_version}-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
  oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
  {project_templates_url}/$\{resource}
done
----
. Run the following command to install the {project_name} {project_version} OpenShift image streams in the `openshift` project:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc -n openshift import-image {openshift_image_repository}:{project_latest_image_tag} --from=registry.redhat.io/{openshift_image_repository}:{project_latest_image_tag} --confirm

=== Deploying the {project_name} Image
[[Preparing-SSO-Authentication-for-OpenShift-Deployment]]
==== Preparing the Deployment
Log in to the OpenShift CLI with a user that holds the _cluster:admin_ role.

. Create a new project:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc new-project sso-app-demo
----
. Add the `view` role to the link:{ocpdocs_default_service_accounts_link}[`default`] service account. This enables the service account to view all the resources in the sso-app-demo namespace, which is necessary for managing the cluster.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default
----

==== Deploying the {project_name} Image using the Application Template

===== Deploying the Template using OpenShift CLI

. List the available {project_name} application templates:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc get templates -n openshift -o name | grep -o '{project_templates_version}.\+'
{project_templates_version}-https
{project_templates_version}-postgresql
{project_templates_version}-postgresql-persistent
{project_templates_version}-x509-https
{project_templates_version}-x509-postgresql-persistent
----
. Deploy the selected one:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc new-app --template={project_templates_version}-x509-https
--> Deploying template "openshift/{project_templates_version}-x509-https" to project sso-app-demo

     {project_name} {project_versionDoc} (Ephemeral)
     ---------
     An example {project_name} 7 application. For more information about using this template, see https://github.com/jboss-openshift/application-templates.

     A new {project_name} service has been created in your project. The admin username/password for accessing the master realm using the {project_name} console is IACfQO8v/nR7llVSVb4Dye3TNRbXoXhRpAKTmiCRc. The HTTPS keystore used for serving secure content, the JGroups keystore used for securing JGroups communications, and server truststore used for securing {project_name} requests were automatically created using OpenShift's service serving x509 certificate secrets.

        * Application Name=sso

Alternatively, perform one of the following procedures to deploy the {project_name} template by using the OpenShift 3.x or 4.x web console.

===== Deploying the Template using the OpenShift 3.x Web Console

. Log in to the OpenShift web console and select the _sso-app-demo_ project space.
. Click *Add to Project*, then *Browse Catalog* to list the default image streams and templates.
. Use the *Filter by Keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match _sso_. You may need to click *Middleware*, then *Integration* to show the desired application template.
. Select an {project_name} application template. This example uses *_{project_name} {project_versionDoc} (Ephemeral)_*.
. Click *Next* in the *Information* step.
. From the *Add to Project* drop-down menu, select the _sso-app-demo_ project space. Then click *Next*.
. Select *Do not bind at this time* radio button in the *Binding* step. Click *Create* to continue.
. In the *Results* step, click the *Continue to the project overview* link to verify the status of the deployment.

===== Deploying the Template using the OpenShift 4.x Web Console

.Prerequisites

* Perform the steps described in xref:image-streams-applications-templates[Using the {project_openshift_product_name} Image Streams and Application Templates].

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift web console and select the _sso-app-demo_ project space.

. On the left sidebar, click the `Administrator` tab and then click `</> Developer`.

. Search for `sso`.
+
image:images/sso_keyword.png[]

. Choose a template such as `Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 on OpenJDK (Ephemeral)`.
+
image:images/choose_template.png[]

. Click `Instantiate Template`.
+
image:images/instantiate_template.png[]

. Adjust the template parameters if necessary and click `Create`.

image:images/verify_deployment.png[]

==== Accessing the Administrator Console of the {project_name} Pod

After the template is deployed, identify the available routes:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc get routes
NAME     HOST/PORT
sso      sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com
----

and access the {project_name} administrator console at:

* *\https://sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com/auth/admin*

using the xref:sso-administrator-setup[administrator account].
