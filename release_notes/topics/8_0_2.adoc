== SameSite cookie changes with upcoming Google Chrome update

Starting with version 80, Google Chrome will change the default value for the `SameSite` cookie parameter to `Lax`.
Therefore, changes were required to several {project_name} cookies (especially those which are used within the
Javascript adapter for checking the session status using the iframe) to set `SameSite` parameter to `None`. Please note
that this setting also requires setting the `Secure` parameter, hence starting with this version, the Javascript
adapter will only be fully functional when using the SSL / TLS connection on the {project_name} side.
