= OpenID Connect and SAML Adapters End-of-life

Some Keycloak OpenID Connect adapters have reached end-of-life and are not included in this release.

== Fuse 6 and 7 (OpenID Connect)

Keycloak will no longer be providing adapters for Fuse 6 or 7. If you need adapters for Fuse please leverage https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On] 7.x adapters.

== JBoss AS 7 and EAP 6 (OpenID Connect and SAML)

JBoss AS 7 has been unmaintained for a very long time. If you are still using JBoss AS 7 we recommend migrating to WildFly and leveraging the native OIDC support in WildFly.

Red Hat customers using Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.x should use https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On] 7.x adapters. These can be used in combination with the Keycloak server.

== Jetty 9.2 and 9.3 (OpenID Connect and SAML)

Jetty 9.2 reached end of life in 2018, while Jetty 9.3 reached end of life in 2020. If you are still using these versions we recommend upgrading to Jetty 9.4 as soon as possible.

== Spring Boot 1 (OpenID Connect)

Spring Boot 1.x reached end of life in 2019. If you are still using Spring Boot 1 we recommend upgrading to Spring Boot 2 as soon as possible.

== WildFly legacy security layer (OpenID Connect and SAML)

In WildFly 25 the legacy security layer was removed, going forward only Elytron will be supported. We recommend anyone using an older version of WildFly to upgrade and leverage native OIDC support in WildFly.

Red Hat customers using Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.x should use https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On] 7.x adapters. These can be used in combination with the Keycloak server.
