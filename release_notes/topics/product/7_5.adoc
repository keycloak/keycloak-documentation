= Overview

Red Hat is proud to announce the release of version 7.5 of {project_name} (RH-SSO). RH-SSO is based on the Keycloak project, and enables you to secure your web applications by providing Web SSO capabilities based on popular standards such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0. The RH-SSO server acts as an OpenID Connect or SAML-based identity provider (IdP), allowing your enterprise user directory or third-party IdP to secure your applications via standards-based security tokens.

[NOTE]
{project_name} for IBM Z and IBM Power Systems is supported only in the OpenShift environment. Bare metal installations on IBM Z and IBM Power Systems are not supported.

The following notes apply to the RH-SSO 7.5 release.

= New or improved features

== Financial-grade API, FAPI CIBA, and Open Banking Brasil

The {project_name} server provides support for the Financial-grade API (FAPI). {project_name} is compliant with the OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) and OpenBanking Brasil. Support also exists for CIBA ping mode.

To ensure that the {project_name} server validates your client to be more secure and FAPI compliant, you can configure FAPI client policies. These policies ensure security best practices such as SSL requirements for clients and secure redirect URI.  For more details, see the FAPI section of link:{adapterguide_link}#_fapi-support[{adapterguide_name}].

== New Account Console
The Account Console, previously called the User Account Service, has been revised and is now the default Account Console in {project_name}. However, if you have a custom theme for the User Account Service, that console remains the default console for this release. Therefore, you have time to update your custom theme to the new Account Console.

The new console uses GZip to optimize the download of artifacts.

== Upgrade login theme to PatternFly 4
The {project_name} login theme components have been upgraded to PatternFly 4. PatternFly 3 runs simultaneously with the new version, so PatternFly 3 components can coexist.

Also, the login theme provides a better user experience and you can define icons for your custom Identity providers. For details, see the link:{developerguide_link}#custom-identity-providers-icons[Server Developer Guide].

== Users can delete their own accounts
You can allow users in a given realm to delete their own account through the Account Console. This capability is enabled by the *Delete Account* action in the Admin Console.

== Identity brokering sync-mode
With Identity Brokering Sync Mode, you can now control if user profiles are updated on the first login or on every login from an external Identity Provider. You can also override this behavior on individual mappers.

== Client Session Timeout for OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0
Typically, an SSO session lasts for days or even months, but individual client sessions should ideally be much shorter. You can now configure a separate timeout for individual clients and a default for all clients within a realm.

You can also configure a client offline session timeout, which determines the maximum time before an offline token is expired and invalidated.

== OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation (RFC 7009)
For applications that use {project_name} as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, you can now revoke refresh tokens through the token revocation endpoint.

== OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)
Support for OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant is now available.

== OpenID Connect Back-channel logout
Support for OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout is now available.

== Improvements to offline sessions
Offline session preloading has been improved, providing faster performance.

== Additional improvements

=== Custom claims for AccessTokenResponse
You can now add custom claims to the AccessTokenResponse. This is a generic enhancement but it supports a healthcare provider standard that is part of US regulations.

=== Support PKCE for identity brokering
{project_name} can now leverage PKCE when brokering to an external OpenID Connect Identity Provider.

=== Improvements to User Profile SPI and support for declarative configuration

The user Profile SPI has been improved to better facilitate management of user profiles. These improvements include support for configuring user profiles through the Admin Console. For more details, see the link:{adminguide_link}#user-profile[{adminguide_name}]

=== SAML Artifact binding in server to client communication

{project_name} now supports communication with clients using SAML _Artifact_ binding. A new `Force Artifact Binding` option is available in the client configuration. It forces communication with the client using artifact messages. For more details, see link:{adminguide_link}#_client-saml-configuration[{adminguide_name}]. Note, that with this version, {project_name} SAML client adapter does NOT support Artifact binding.

=== Default roles processing improvement

Default roles are now internally stored as new composite roles, which are typically named `default-roles-<realmName>`. Previously realm roles and client default roles were directly assigned to new users and to users who were imported through Identity Brokering. However, now the composite role is assigned to them and other default roles are assigned as effective roles. This change improves performance of default roles processing, especially with a larger number of clients. It is no longer necessary to go through all clients.

=== Not email password policy
You can use a Not Email policy to disallow a password to be the same as the email address.

=== Support for a redirect-uri for any port with \http://127.0.0.1
\http://localhost is used as a callback when an HTTP server is started on a random port. The best practice is to use \http://127.0.0.1 instead of localhost.

== Other improvements

* Support for invoking Application Initiated Actions added to {project_name} JavaScript adapter.
* Support for AES 192 and AES 256 algorithms used for signed and encrypted ID tokens.
* Support for OAuth2 Client Credentials grant without refresh token and without user session.
* Support for send access tokens to the OAuth2 Revocation endpoint.
* Support for configuring a maximum number of active authentication sessions. The default value is set to 300 authentication sessions (browser tabs) per browser session.
* Support for LDAPv3 password modify operation, including the Admin Console ability to request metadata from the configured LDAP server to see if it supports LDAPv3 password modify operations.
* Namespace support for LDAP group mapper. You can map groups from LDAP under a specified branch (namespace) of the {project_name} groups tree. Previously groups from LDAP were always added as the top level groups in {project_name}
* Support for specification of AuthnContext section in authentication requests issued by a SAML identity provider has been added.
* Performance improvements to fetching resources and policies during evaluation
* A new Identity Provider Mapper, `OIDC Advanced attribute to role mapper`, was added as a counterpart to the SAML mapper, Advanced Claim to Role Mapper.  The new mapper supports regex for attribute values and multiple attribute values.

= Existing technology preview features

The following features continue to be in a Technology Preview status:

* Cross-site data replication

* RH-SSO Operator

* Token exchange

* Fine-grained authorization permissions

* W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)


= Removed or deprecated features

These features have a change in status:

* RH-SSO 7.5 does not support installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL 6). RHEL 6 entered the ELS phase of its lifecycle on November 30, 2020.  Customers should deploy their RH-SSO 7.5 upgrades on RHEL 7 or 8 versions.
* Installation from an RPM is deprecated. RH-SSO will continue to deliver RPMs for the life of the 7.x product, but will not deliver RPMs with the next major version. The product will continue to support installation from a ZIP file and installation on OpenShift.
* Authorization Services Drools Policy was removed at RH-SSO 7.4.
* Upload of scripts through admin rest endpoints/console is deprecated. It will be removed at a future release.
