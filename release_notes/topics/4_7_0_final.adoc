= Enhanced Remember Me

Introduced the ability to specify different session idle and max timeouts for remember me sessions. This enables remember
me sessions to live longer than regular sessions.

= Pagination support for Groups

Large numbers of groups have previously caused issues in the admin console. This is now resolved by the introduction of
pagination of groups.

= Improve startup time with large number of offline sessions

In the past, starting the server could take a long time if there were many offline sessions. This startup time has now
been significantly reduced.
