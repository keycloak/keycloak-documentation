= Hostname SPI

The hostname SPI introduces a more flexible way to configure the hostname for {project_name}. There are two
built-in providers. The first is request, which uses the request headers to determine the hostname. The second
is fixed, which allows configuring a fixed hostname. The latter makes sure that only valid hostnames can be
used and also allows internal applications to invoke {project_name} through an alternative URL.

For more details refer to the threat mitigation section in the link:{adminguide_link}[{adminguide_name}].

= X509 Client Authenticator

The newly added Client Authenticator uses X509 Client Certificates and Mutual TLS to secure a connection from the client. In addition to that
the Keycloak Server validates Subject DN field of the client's certificate.

= Performance improvements to Authorization Services

For this release, we improved policy evaluation performance across the board, increasing reliability and throughput. The main
changes we did were related with trying to optimize the policy evaluation path by avoiding unnecessary flows and collect decisions
as soon as they happen. We also introduced a policy decision cache on a per request basis, avoiding redundant decisions from policies
previously evaluated.

We are also working on other layers of cache which should give a much better experience. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-7952[KEYCLOAK-7952].

= Choosing the response mode when obtaining permissions from the server

In previous versions, permissions were always returned from the server using standard OAuth2 response, containing the access and refresh tokens. In this release,
clients can use a `response_mode` parameter to specify how the server should respond to an authorization request. This parameter accepts two values:

* `decision`
+
Indicating that responses should only contain a flag indicating whether or not permissions were granted by the server. Otherwise a `403` HTTP status code is returned.
+
* `permissions`
+
Indicating that a response should contain every single permission granted by the server using a JSON format.

= NodeJS Policy Enforcer

The https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-nodejs-connect[keycloak-nodejs-connect], an adapter for NodeJS, now supports constructs to protect
resources based on decisions taken from the server. The new construct allows users to protect their resources using fine-grained permissions as follows:

```js
app.get('/protected/resource', keycloak.enforcer('resource:view'), function (req, res) {
  res.json({message: 'access granted'});
});
```

= Support hosted domain for Google logins

Login with Google now supports the `hd` parameter to restrict Google logins to a specific hosted domain at Google. When
this is specified in the identity provider any login from a different domain is rejected.

= Escape unsafe tags in HTML output

Most HTML output is already escaped for HTML tags, but there are some places where HTML tags are permitted.
These are only where admin access is needed to update the value. Even though it would require admin access to update such
fields we have added an extra layer of defence and are now escaping unsafe elements like `<script>`.
