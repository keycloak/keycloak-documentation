= Hostname SPI

The hostname SPI introduces a more flexible way to configure the hostname for {project_name}. There are two
built-in providers. The first is request, which uses the request headers to determine the hostname. The second
is fixed, which allows configuring a fixed hostname. The latter makes sure that only valid hostnames can be
used and also allows internal applications to invoke {project_name} through an alternative URL.

= X509 Client Authenticator

The newly added Client Authenticator uses X509 Client Certificates and Mutual TLS to secure a connection from the client. In addition to that
the Keycloak Server validates Subject DN field of the client's certificate.
