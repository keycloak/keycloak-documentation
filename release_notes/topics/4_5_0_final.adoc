= Signature SPI

The Signature SPI makes it possible to plug-in additional signature algorithms. Not only does it enable
additional signatures, but it also enables changing how signatures are generated. For example this would allow
using an HSM device to sign tokens.

= New Signature Algorithms

Alongside the Signature SPI there is now also support for additional signature algorithms.

Keycloak now has support for RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, HS256, HS384 and HS512.

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ES256/384/512) are very interesting as they provide similar
security properties as RSA signatures, but uses significantly less CPU.

HMAC (HS256/384/512) are also very useful when you do not want your application to verify the signature itself.
Since these are symmetric signatures only Keycloak is able to verify the signature, which requires the
application to use the token introspection endpoint to verify tokens.
