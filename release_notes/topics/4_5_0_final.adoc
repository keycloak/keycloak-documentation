= Signature SPI

The Signature SPI makes it possible to plug-in additional signature algorithms. This enables additional signatures and also enables changing how signatures are generated. For example, using this allows using an HSM device to sign tokens.

= New Signature Algorithms

Alongside the Signature SPI there is now also support for additional signature algorithms.

Keycloak now has support for RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, HS256, HS384 and HS512.

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ES256/384/512) are very interesting as they provide similar
security properties as RSA signatures, but use significantly less CPU.

HMAC (HS256/384/512) are also very useful when you do not want your application to verify the signature itself.
Since these are symmetric signatures only Keycloak is able to verify the signature, which requires the
application to use the token introspection endpoint to verify tokens.

= Better Audience Support for OpenID Connect clients

It is now possible to specify the audiences in the tokens issued for OpenID Connect clients. There is also support for verification
of audience on the adapter side.

= Minor improvements

* Added LocaleSelector SPI, which allows to change the way how the locale will be resolved for a particular request. Thanks to https://github.com/knutz3n[knutz3n]
* Added an authenticator to automatically link Identity Provider identity to an existing account after first Idp authentication. Thanks to https://github.com/slominskir[slominskir]
