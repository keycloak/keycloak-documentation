= Highlights

== Improved User Search

{project_name} now supports a glob-like syntax for the user search when listing users in the Admin Console,
which allows for three different types of searches: prefix (`foo*` which became the default search), infix (`\*foo*`), and exact `"foo"`)

== Offline sessions lazy loaded

The offline sessions are now lazily fetched from the database by default instead of preloading during the server startup.
To change the default behavior, see link:{adminguide_link}#offline-sessions-preloading[{adminguide_name}].
