== FAPI RW support and initial support to Client policies

There was lots of the work done to have support for Financial-grade API Read and Write API Security Profile (FAPI RW). This is available
with the usage of Client policies and it is still in the preview state. You can expect more polishing in the next releases.
Thanks to https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu] and all the members of the https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi[FAPI Special interest group].

== Upgrade login theme to PatternFly 4

The {project_name} login theme components have been upgraded to PatternFly 4.
The old PatternFly 3 runs simultaneously with the new one, so it's possible to have PF3 components there.

There are also design changes in login theme for better user experience.
You can even define an icon for your custom Identity providers.
For details, please refer to the link:{developerguide_link}#custom-identity-providers-icons[docs].

== Other improvements

* Support for OAuth2 Client Credentials grant without refresh token and without user session. Thanks to https://github.com/thomasdarimont[Thomas Darimont]
* Support for send access tokens to the OAuth2 Revocation endpoint
