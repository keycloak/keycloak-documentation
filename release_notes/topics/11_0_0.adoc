== LDAPv3 password modify operation

Support for LDAPv3 password modify operation was added. Also the ability in the admin console to request metadata from the configured
LDAP server to see if it supports LDAPv3 password modify operation.

== Namespace support for LDAP group mapper

Namespace support for LDAP group mapper allows you to map groups from LDAP under specified branch (namespace) of the Keycloak groups tree.
Previously groups from LDAP were always added as the top level groups in Keycloak.

== Upgrade to WildFly 20

Keycloak server was upgraded to use WildFly 20.0.1.Final under the covers. For more details,
please take a look at link:{upgradingguide_link_latest}[{upgradingguide_name}].


== SAML POST binding is broken in the latest versions of browsers

The `SameSite` value `None` for `JSESSIONID` cookie is necessary for correct behavior of the {project_name} SAML adapter.
Usage of a different value is causing resetting of the container's session with each request to {project_name}, when
the SAML POST binging is used. Refer to the following steps for
link:{adapterguide_link}#_saml-jboss-adapter-samesite-setting[Wildfly] and
link:{adapterguide_link}#_saml-tomcat-adapter-samesite-setting[Tomcat] to keep the correct behavior. Notice, that this
workaround should be working also with the previous versions of the adapter.
