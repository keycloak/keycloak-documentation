= Upgrade to WildFly 13

The {project_name} server was upgraded to use WildFly 13 under the covers. This means update of the underlying dependencies and also
some changes in the configuration. We now also support WildFly 13 adapter and we upgraded the underlying JDG/Infinispan server version for
the Cross-DC setup. See link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details.
