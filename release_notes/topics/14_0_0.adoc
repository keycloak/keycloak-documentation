== Client Policies and Financial-grade API (FAPI) Support

The {project_name} server has now official support for client policies and Financial-grade API (FAPI). This capability was previewed in earlier versions, but now
it is more polished and properly documented. Thanks to https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu], who did most of the work on this. Also thanks
to https://github.com/andriimurashkin[Andrii Murashkin] and https://github.com/HryhoriiHevorkian[Hryhorii Hevorkian], who did a great deal of the work on this feature as well.
Finally thanks to all the members of the https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi/blob/master/members.adoc[FAPI Special interest group] for their help and feedback.

== Other improvements

* The support for configuring maximum number of active authentication sessions. The default value is set to 300 authentication sessions (browser tabs) per a browser's session
