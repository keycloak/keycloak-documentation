= Known issues

This release includes the following known issues:

* After upgrading H2 database from the version `1.4.199` to the version
`1.4.200`, we encountered intermittent failures when the configured isolation
level is lower than `REPEATABLE_READ`. In Keycloak distribution, the
`REPEATABLE_READ` isolation level is used by default when H2 is configured
as the database. This does not change support level for H2 which is still
only packed for development purposes and not supported in production.
