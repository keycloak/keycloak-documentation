= Context and dependency injection no longer enabled to JAX-RS Resources

In order to provide a better runtime and leverage as much as possible the underlying stack,
all injection points for contextual data using the `javax.ws.rs.core.Context` annotation were removed. The expected improvement
in performance involves no longer creating proxies instances multiple times during the request lifecycle, and drastically reducing the amount of reflection calls at runtime.

This change is also about changing our underlying JAX-RS implementation from Resteasy Classic to Resteasy Reactive.

If you are extending one of the following SPIs:

* `PolicySpi`
* `AdminRealmResourceSpi`
* `IdentityProviderSpi`
