= Old Admin Console removed

In Keycloak 19 the new admin console was graduated to the new default admin console, and the old admin console was
deprecated. In this release the old admin console has been removed completely.

= Keycloak uses Micrometer for metrics

Keycloak provides an optional a metrics endpoint which exports metrics in the Prometheus format.
In this release the implementation to provide this data switched from SmallRye to Micrometer.
Due to this change, metrics have been renamed.

See the migration guide for details.

= Java 11 support for Keycloak server deprecated

Running the Keycloak server with Java 11 is now deprecated, and planned to be removed in Keycloak 22.

Adapters remain supported on Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17. However, we are planning to remove support for Java 8 in the
not too distant future.

= Hashicop Vault no longer supported

We removed the out-of-box support for Hashicorp vault in this release.

See this https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/16446[discussion] for more details.

= SAML SP metadata changes

Prior to this release, SAML SP metadata contained the same key for both
signing and encryption use. Starting with this version of Keycloak,
we include only encryption intended realm keys for encryption use
in SP metadata. For each encryption key descriptor we also specify
the algorithm that it is supposed to be used with. The following table shows
the supported XML-Enc algorithms with the mapping to Keycloak realm keys.
See the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details.

= Deprecated methods from user session provider were removed

Several deprecated methods were removed from user session provider. If not done already,
their usage needs to be replaced with the corresponding replacement documented in Javadoc
of Keycloak 20 release. See link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details.

= New storage: `IS_CLIENT_ROLE` searchable field was deprecated

The `IS_CLIENT_ROLE` searchable field from the `RoleModel` was deprecated. It
should be replaced with the `CLIENT_ID` searchable field used with the operators
`EXISTS` or `NOT_EXISTS`. See JavaDoc of Keycloak 21 for more details.

= FIPS 140-2 preview support

FIPS 140-2 support in Keycloak, which was experimental in the previous release, is now promoted to preview. There was lots of fixes and polishing done.
