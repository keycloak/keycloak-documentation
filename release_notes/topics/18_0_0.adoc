== New Operator preview

With this release, we're introducing a brand new {project_operator} as a tech-preview. Apart from being rewritten from
scratch, the main user-facing change from the legacy Operator is the used {project_name} distribution â€“ the new Operator
uses the Quarkus distribution of {project_name}. With that, the API (in form of Custom Resource Definitions) has changed.
For details, incl. installation and migration instructions, see the https://www.keycloak.org/guides#operator[Operator related guides].

The link:{operatorRepo_link}[legacy Operator] will receive updates until Keycloak 20 when the {project_name} WildFly
distribution reaches EOL.

=== OperatorHub versioning scheme
To avoid version conflicts with the legacy Operator, the 18.0.0 version of the new Operator is released as version
`20.0.0-alpha.1` on OperatorHub. The legacy Operator versioning scheme remains the same, i.e. it is released as 18.0.0.

The same pattern will apply for future {project_name} 18 and 19 releases, until version 20 where the legacy Operator
reaches EOL.

== New Admin Console preview

The new Admin Console is now graduated to preview, with the plan for it to become the default admin console in Keycloak 19.

If you find any issues with the new console, or have some suggestions for improvements, please let us know through https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/new-admin-console[GitHub Discussions].

== Step-up authentication

{project_name} now supports Step-up authentication. This feature was added in Keycloak 17, and was further polished in this version.

== Client secret rotation

{project_name} now supports Client Secret Rotation through customer policies. This feature is now available as a preview feature and allows that confidential clients can be provided with realm policies allowing the use up to two secrets simultaneously.

For more details, see link:{adminguide_link}#_secret_rotation[{adminguide_name}].

== Recovery Codes

Recovery Codes as another way to do two-factor authentication is now available as a preview feature.

== OpenID Connect Logout Improvements

Some fixes and improvements were made to make sure that {project_name} is now fully compliant with all the OpenID Connect logout specifications:

* OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0
* OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0
* OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0
* OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0

For more details, see link:{adminguide_link}#_oidc-logout[{adminguide_name}].

== WebAuthn improvements

{project_name} now supports WebAuthn id-less authentication. This feature allows that WebAuthn Security Key will identify the user during authentication as long as the
security key supports Resident Keys. For more details, see link:{adminguide_link}#_webauthn_loginless[{adminguide_name}].
Thanks to https://github.com/vanrar68[Joaquim Fellmann] for the contribution.

There are more WebAuthn improvements and fixes in addition to that.

== Session limits

{project_name} now supports limits on the number of sessions a user can have. Limits can be placed at the realm level or at the client level.

For more details, see link:{adminguide_link}#_user_session_limits[{adminguide_name}].
