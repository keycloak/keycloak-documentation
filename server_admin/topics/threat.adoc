This chapter discusses possible security vulnerabilities any authentication server could have and how {project_name}
mitigates those vulnerabilities.
A good list of potential vulnerabilities and what security implementations should do to mitigate them can be found in
the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819[OAuth 2.0 Threat Model] document and its most recent extension https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-15[OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice] put out by the IETF.
Many of those vulnerabilities are discussed here.
