=== Host

{project_name} uses the public hostname for a number of things. For example, in the token issuer fields and URLs sent in
password reset emails.

By default, the hostname is based on the request headers and there is no check to make sure this hostname is valid.

If you are not using a load balancer or proxy in front of {project_name} that prevents invalid host headers, you must
explicitly configure what hostnames should be accepted.

The Hostname SPI provides a way to configure the hostname for a request. Out of the box there are two providers. These are
request and fixed. It is also possible to develop your own provider in the case the built-in providers do not provide
the functionality needed.

==== Request provider

This is the default hostname provider and uses request headers to determine the hostname. As it uses the headers from
the request it is important to use this in combination with a proxy or a filter that rejects invalid hostnames.

It is beyond the scope of this documentation to provide instructions on how to configure valid hostnames for a proxy. To
configure it in a filter you need to edit standalone.xml to set permitted aliases for the server. The following example
will only permit requests to `auth.example.com`:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="{subsystem_undertow_xml_urn}">
    <server name="default-server" default-host="ignore">
        ...
        <host name="default-host" alias="auth.example.com">
            <location name="/" handler="welcome-content"/>
            <http-invoker security-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>
        </host>
    </server>
</subsystem>
----

The changes that have been made from the default config is to add the attribute `default-host="ignore"` and update the
attribute `alias`. `default-host="ignore"` prevents unknown hosts from being handled, while `alias` is used to list the
accepted hosts.

Here is the equivalent configuration using CLI commands:

[source,bash]
----
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server:write-attribute(name=default-host,value=ignore)
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/host=default-host:write-attribute(name=alias,value=[auth.example.com]

:reload
----

==== Fixed provider

The fixed provider makes it possible to configure a fixed hostname. Unlike the request provider the fixed
provider allows internal applications to invoke {project_name} on an alternative URL (for example an internal IP
address). It is also possible to override the hostname for a specific realm through the configuration of the realm in the
admin console.

This is the recommended provider to use in production.

To change to the fixed provider and configure the hostname edit standalone.xml. The following example shows the fixed
provider with the hostname set to auth.example.com:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="hostname">
    <default-provider>fixed</default-provider>
    <provider name="fixed" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="hostname" value="auth.example.com"/>
            <property name="httpPort" value="-1"/>
            <property name="httpsPort" value="-1"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

Here is the equivalent configuration using CLI commands:

[source,bash]
----
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=hostname:write-attribute(name=default-provider, value="fixed")
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=hostname/provider=fixed:write-attribute(name=properties.hostname,value="auth.example.com")
----

By default the `httpPort` and `httpsPort` are received from the request. As long as any proxies are configured correctly
it should not be necessary to change this. It is possible to configure fixed ports if necessary by setting the `httpPort` and
`httpsPort` properties on the fixed provider.

In most cases the scheme should be set correctly. This may not be true if the reverse proxy is unable to set the `X-Forwarded-For` header
correctly, or if there is an internal application using non-https to invoke {project_name}. In such cases it is possible
to set the `alwaysHttps` to `true`.

==== Custom provider

To develop a custom hostname provider you need to implement `org.keycloak.urls.HostnameProviderFactory` and
`org.keycloak.urls.HostnameProvider`.
