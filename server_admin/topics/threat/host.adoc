=== Host

{project_name} uses the public hostname in several ways, such as within token issuer fields and URLs in password reset emails.

By default, the hostname derives from request headers. No validation exists to ensure a hostname is valid. If you are not using a load balancer, or proxy, with {project_name} to prevent invalid host headers, configure the acceptable hostnames.

The hostname's Service Provider Interface (SPI) provides a way to configure the hostname for requests. You can use this built-in provider to set a fixed URL for frontend requests while allowing backend requests based on the request URI. If the built-in provider does not have the required capability, you can develop a customized provider.
