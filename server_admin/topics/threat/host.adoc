=== Host

{project_name} uses the public hostname for a number of things. For example, in the token issuer fields and URLs sent in
password reset emails.

By default, the hostname is based on the request headers and there is no check to make sure this hostname is valid.

If you are not using a load balancer or proxy in front of {project_name} that prevents invalid host headers, you must
explicitly configure what hostnames should be accepted.

The Hostname SPI provides a way to configure the hostname for a request. The out of the box provider allows setting
a fixed URL for frontend requests, while allowing backend requests to be based on the request URI. It is also possible
to develop your own provider in the case the built-in provider does not provide the functionality needed.
