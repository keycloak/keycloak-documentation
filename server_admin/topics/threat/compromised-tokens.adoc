=== Compromised access and refresh tokens

{project_name} includes several actions to prevent malicious actors from stealing access tokens and refresh tokens. The crucial action is to enforce SSL/HTTPS communication between {project_name} and its clients and applications. {project_name} does not enable SSL by default.

Another action to mitigate damage from leaked access tokens is to shorten the token's lifespans. You can specify token lifespans within the <<_timeouts, timeouts page>>. Short lifespans for access tokens force clients and applications to refresh their access tokens after a short time. If an admin detects a leak, the admin can log out all user sessions to invalidate these refresh tokens or set up a revocation policy. 

Ensure refresh tokens always stay private to the client and are never transmitted.

You can mitigate damage from leaked access tokens and refresh tokens by issuing these tokens as holder-of-key tokens. See <<_mtls-client-certificate-bound-tokens, OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Certificate Bound Access Token>> for more information.

If an access token or refresh token is compromised, access the Admin Console and push a not-before revocation policy to all applications. Pushing a not-before policy ensures that any tokens issued before that time become invalid. 
Pushing a new not-before policy ensures that applications must download new public keys from {project_name} and mitigate damage from a compromised realm signing key. See the <<realm_keys, keys chapter>> for more information.

You can disable specific applications, clients, or users if they are compromised.
