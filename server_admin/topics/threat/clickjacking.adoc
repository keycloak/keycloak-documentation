=== Clickjacking

Clickjacking is a technique of tricking users into clicking on a user interface element different from what users perceive. A malicious site loads the target site in a transparent iFrame, overlaid on top of a set of dummy buttons placed directly under important buttons on the target site. When a user clicks a visible button, they are clicking a button on the hidden page. An attacker can steal a user's authentication credentials and access their resources by using this method.

By default, every response by {project_name} sets some specific HTTP headers that can prevent this from happening.
Specifically, it sets https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7034[X-Frame-Options] and https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/[Content-Security-Policy].
You should take a look at the definition of both of these headers as there is a lot of fine-grain browser access you can control.

.Procedure
In the Admin Console, you can specify the values of the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers.

. Click the *Realm Settings* menu item.
. Click the *Security Defenses* tab.

By default, {project_name} only sets up a _same-origin_ policy for iframes.
