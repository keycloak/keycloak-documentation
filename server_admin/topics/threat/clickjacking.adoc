=== Clickjacking

Clickjacking is a technique of tricking users into clicking on a user interface element different from what users perceive. A malicious site loads the target site in a transparent iFrame, overlaid on top of a set of dummy buttons placed directly under important buttons on the target site. When a user clicks a visible button, they are clicking a button on the hidden page. An attacker can steal a user's authentication credentials and access their resources by using this method.

By default, every response by {project_name} sets some specific browser headers that can prevent this from happening.
Specifically, it sets https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7034[X-FRAME_OPTIONS] and http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/[Content-Security-Policy].
You should take a look at the definition of both of these headers as there is a lot of fine-grain browser access you can control.
In the admin console you can specify the values these headers will have.  Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and
click the `Security Defenses` tab and make sure you are on the `Headers` sub-tab.
