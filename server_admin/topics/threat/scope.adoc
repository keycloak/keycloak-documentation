=== Limiting Scope

By default, new client applications have unlimited `role scope mappings`. Every access token for that client contains all permissions that the user has. If an attacker compromises the client and obtains the client's access tokens, each system that the user can access is compromised. 

Limit the roles of an access token by using the <<_role_scope_mappings, Scope menu>> for each client. Alternatively, you can set role scope mappings at the Client Scope level and assign Client Scopes to your client by using the <<_client_scopes_linking, Client Scope menu>>.
