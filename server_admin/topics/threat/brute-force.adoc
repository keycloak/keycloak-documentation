=== Password guess: brute force attacks

A brute force attack happens when an attacker is trying to guess a user's password.
{project_name} has some limited brute force detection capabilities.
If turned on, a user account will be temporarily disabled if a threshold of login failures is reached.
To enable this feature go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item, click on the `Security Defenses` tab, then additional
go to the `Brute Force Detection` sub-tab.

There are 2 different configurations for brute force detection; permanent lockout and temporary lockout. Permanent lockout will disable a user's account after an attack is detected; the account will be disabled until an administrator renables it. Temporary lockout will disable a user's account for a time period after an attack is detected; the time period for which the account is disabled increases the longer the attack continues.

*Common Parameters*
====
Max Login Failures::
  Maximum number of login failures permitted. Default value is 30.
Quick Login Check Milli Seconds::
  Minimum time required between login attempts. Default is 1000.
Minimum Quick Login Wait::
  Minimum amount of time the user will be temporarily disabled if logins attempts are quicker than _Quick Login Check Milli Seconds_. Default is 1 minute.
====

*Temporary Lockout Parameters*
====
Wait Increment::
  Amount of time added to the time a user is temporarily disabled after each time _Max Login Failures_ is reached. Default is 1 minute.
Max Wait::
  The maximum amount of time for which a user will be temporarily disabled. Default is 15 minutes.
Failure Reset Time::
  Time after which the failure count will be reset; timer runs from the last failed login. Default is 12 hours.

*Permanent Lockout Algorithm*
====
. On successful login
.. Reset `count`
. On failed login
.. Increment `count`
.. If `count` greater than _Max Login Failures_
... Permanently disable user
.. Else if time between this failure and the last failure is less than _Quick Login Check Milli Seconds_
... Temporarily disable user for _Minimum Quick Login Wait_

When a user is disabled they can not login until an administrator enables the user; enabling an account resets `count`.
====

*Temporary Lockout Algorithm*
====
. On successful login
.. Reset `count`
. On failed login
.. If time between this failure and the last failure is greater than _Failure Reset Time_
... Reset `count`
.. Increment `count`
.. Calculate `wait` using _Wait Increment_ * (`count` / _Max Login Failures_). The division is an integer division so will always be rounded down to a whole number
.. If `wait` equals 0 and time between this failure and the last failure is less than _Quick Login Check Milli Seconds_ then set `wait` to _Minimum Quick Login Wait_ instead
... Temporarily disable the user for the smaller of `wait` and _Max Wait_ seconds

Login failures when a user is temporarily disabled do not increment `count`.

The downside of {project_name} brute force detection is that the server becomes vulnerable to denial of service attacks.
An attacker can simply try to guess passwords for any accounts it knows and these account will be disabled.
Eventually we will expand this functionality to take client IP address into account when deciding whether to block a user.

A better option might be a tool like http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page[Fail2Ban].  You can point this service at the {project_name} server's log file.
{project_name} logs every login failure and client IP address that had the failure.  Fail2Ban can be used to modify
firewalls after it detects an attack to block connections from specific IP addresses.

==== Password Policies

Another thing you should do to prevent password guess is to have a complex enough password policy to ensure that
users pick hard to guess passwords.  See the <<_password-policies, Password Policies>> chapter for more details.

The best way to prevent password guessing though is to set up the server to use a one-time-password (OTP).
