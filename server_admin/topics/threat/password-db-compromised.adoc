=== Password database compromised

{project_name} does not store passwords in raw text but as hashed text, using the PBKDF2 hashing algorithm. {project_name} performs 27,500 hashing iterations, the number of iterations recommended by the security community. This number of hashing iterations can adversely affect performance as PBKDF2 hashing uses a significant amount of CPU resources.
