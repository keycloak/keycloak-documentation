= Creating an OpenID Connect client

[role="_abstract"]
To protect an application that uses the OpenID connect protocol, you create a client.

.Procedure

. Click *Clients* in the menu.
. Click *Create client*.
+
.Create client
image:images/add-client-oidc.png[Create Client]
. Leave *Client type* set to *OpenID Connect*.
. Enter a *Client ID.*
+
This ID is an alphanumeric string that is used in OIDC requests and in the {project_name} database to identify the client.
. Supply a *Name* for the client.
+
If you plan to localize this name, set up a replacement string value. For example, a string value such as $\{myapp}.  See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

. Click *Save*.

This action creates the client and bring you to the *Settings* tab, where you can perform xref:con-basic-settings_{context}[Basic configuration].
