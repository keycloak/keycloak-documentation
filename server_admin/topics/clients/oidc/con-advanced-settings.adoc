[[_mtls-client-certificate-bound-tokens]]
*OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Certificate Bound Access Tokens Enabled*

[NOTE]
====
To enable mutual TLS in {project_name}, see <<_enable-mtls-wildfly, Enable mutual SSL in WildFly>>.
====

Mutual TLS binds an access token and a refresh token together with a client certificate, which is exchanged during a TLS handshake. This binding prevents an attacker from using stolen tokens.

This type of token is a holder-of-key token. Unlike bearer tokens, the recipient of a holder-of-key token can verify if the sender of the token is legitimate.

If this setting is on, the workflow is:

. A token request is sent to the token endpoint in an authorization code flow or hybrid flow.
. {project_name} requests a client certificate.
. {project_name} receives the client certificate.
. {project_name} successfully verifies the client certificate.

If verification fails, {project_name} rejects the token.

In the following cases, {project_name} will verify the client sending the access token or the refresh token:

* A token refresh request is sent to the token endpoint with a holder-of-key refresh token.
* A UserInfo request is sent to UserInfo endpoint with a holder-of-key access token.
* A logout request is sent to Logout endpoint with a holder-of-key refresh token.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-08#section-3[Mutual TLS Client Certificate Bound Access Tokens] in the OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate Bound Access Tokens for more details.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, {project_name} client adapters do not support holder-of-key token verification. {project_name} adapters treat access and refresh tokens as bearer tokens.

[[_proof-key-for-code-exchange]]
*Proof Key for Code Exchange Code Challenge Method*

If an attacker steals an authorization code of a legitimate client, Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) prevents the attacker from receiving the tokens that apply to the code.

An administrator can select one of these options:

`(blank)`:: {project_name} does not apply PKCE unless the client sends appropriate PKCE parameters to {project_name}s authorization endpoint.
`S256`:: {project_name} applies to the client PKCE whose code challenge method is S256.
`plain`:: {project_name} applies to the client PKCE whose code challenge method is plain.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[RFC 7636 Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients] for more details.

[[_jwe-id-token-encryption]]
*Signed and Encrypted ID Token Support*

{project_name} can encrypt ID tokens according to the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516[Json Web Encryption (JWE)] specification. The administrator determines if ID tokens are encrypted for each client.

The key used for encrypting the ID token is the Content Encryption Key (CEK). {project_name} and a client must negotiate which CEK is used and how it is delivered. The method used to determine the CEK is the Key Management Mode. The Key Management Mode that {project_name} supports is Key Encryption.

In Key Encryption:

. The client generates an asymmetric cryptographic key pair.
. The public key is used to encrypt the CEK. 
. {project_name} generates a CEK per ID token
. {project_name} encrypts the ID token using this generated CEK
. {project_name} encrypts the CEK using the client's public key. 
. The client decrypts this encrypted CEK using their private key
. The client decrypts the ID token using the decrypted CEK. 

No party, other than the client, can decrypt the ID token.

The client must pass its public key for encrypting CEK to {project_name}. {project_name} supports downloading public keys from a URL provided by the client. The client must provide public keys according to the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517[Json Web Keys (JWK)] specification. 

The procedure is:

. Open the client's `Credentials` tab.
. Select `Signed Jwt` from the `Client Authenticator` menu.
. Set the `JWKS URL` switch to ON.
. Input the client's public key URL in the `JWKS URL` textbox.

Key Encryption's algorithms are defined in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-4.1[Json Web Algorithm (JWA)] specification. {project_name} supports:

* RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5(RSA1_5)
* RSAES OAEP using default parameters (RSA-OAEP)
* RSAES OAEP 256 using SHA-256 and MFG1 (RSA-OAEP-256)

The procedure to select the algorithm is:

. Open the client's `Settings` tab.
. Open `Fine Grain OpenID Connect Configuration`.
. Select the algorithm from `ID Token Encryption Content Encryption Algorithm` pulldown menu.
