=== OIDC Token and SAML Assertion Mappings

[role="_abstract"]
Applications receiving ID tokens, access tokens, or SAML assertions may require different roles and user metadata. 

You can use {project_name} to:

* Hardcode roles, claims and custom attributes.
* Pull user metadata into a token or assertion.
* Rename roles.

You perform these actions in the *Mappers* tab in the Admin Console.

New clients do not have built-in mappers but they can inherit some mappers from client scopes. See the <<_client_scopes, client scopes section>> for more details. 

Protocol mappers map items (such as an email address, for example) to
a specific claim in the identity and access token. The function of a mapper should be self explanatory from its name. You  add pre-configured mappers by clicking *Add Builtin*.

Each mapper has a set of common settings. Additional settings are available, depending on the mapper type. Click *Edit* next to a mapper to access the configuration screen to adjust these settings.

.Mapper Config

Details on each option can be viewed by hovering over its tooltip.

Use OIDC mappers to control where the claim gets placed. You opt to include or exclude the claim from the _id_ and _access_ tokens by adjusting the *Add to ID token* and *Add to access token* switches.

==== Priority order

Mapper implementations have _priority order_. _Priority order_ is not the configuration property of the mapper. It is the property of the concrete implementation of the mapper.

Mappers are sorted by the order in the list of mappers. The changes in the token or assertion are applied in that order with the lowest applying first. Therefore, the implementations that are dependent on other implementations are processed in the necessary order.

For example, to compute the roles which will be included with a token:

. Resolve audiences based on those roles.
. Process a JavaScript script that uses the roles and audiences already available in the token.

==== OIDC User Session Note Mappers

User session details are defined using mappers and are automatically included when you use or enable a feature on a client. Click *Add builtin* to include session details.

Impersonated user sessions provide the following details:

* *IMPERSONATOR_ID*: The ID of an impersonating user.
* *IMPERSONATOR_USERNAME*: The username of an impersonating user.

Service account sessions provide the following details:

* *clientId*: The client ID of the service account.
* *clientAddress*: The remote host IP of the service account's authenticated device.
* *clientHost*: The remote host name of the service account's authenticated device.

==== Script Mapper

Use the *Script Mapper* to map claims to tokens by running user-defined JavaScript code. For more details about deploying scripts to the server, see link:{developerguide_jsproviders_link}[{developerguide_jsproviders_name}].

When scripts deploy, you should be able to select the deployed scripts from the list of available mappers.
