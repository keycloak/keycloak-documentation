=== Client Scopes

If you have many applications you need to secure and register within your organization, it can become tedious to configure the
<<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_role_scope_mappings, role scope mappings>> for each of these clients. {project_name} allows
you to define a shared client configuration in an entity called a _client scope_.

Client scopes also provide support for the OAuth 2 `scope` parameter, which allows a client application to request more or fewer
claims or roles in the access token, according to the application needs.

To create a client scope, follow these steps:

* Go to the `Client Scopes` left menu item. This initial screen shows you a list of currently defined client scopes.

.Client Scopes List

* Click the `Create` button. Name the client scope and save. A _client scope_ will have similar tabs to a regular clients. You can
define <<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_role_scope_mappings, role scope mappings>>, which can be inherited by other clients,
and which are configured to inherit from this client scope.

==== Protocol

When you are creating the client scope, you must choose the `Protocol`. Only the clients which use same protocol can then be linked
with this client scope.

Once you have created new realm, you can see that there is a list of pre-defined (builtin) client scopes in the menu.

* For the SAML protocol, there is one builtin client scope, `roles_list`, which contains one protocol mapper for showing the roles
list in the SAML assertion.
* For the OpenID Connect protocol, there are client scopes `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`, `offline_access`, `roles`,
`web-origins` and `microprofile-jwt`.

The client scope, `offline_access`, is useful when client wants to obtain offline tokens. Learn about offline tokens in the
<<_offline-access, Offline Access section>> or in the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess[OpenID Connect specification],
where scope parameter is defined with the value `offline_access`.

The client scopes `profile`, `email`, `address` and `phone` are also defined in the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims[OpenID Connect specification].
These client scopes do not have any role scope mappings defined, but they have some protocol mappers defined, and these mappers correspond
to the claims defined in the OpenID Connect specification.

For example, when you click to open the `phone` client scope and open the `Mappers` tab, you will see the protocol mappers, which
correspond to the claims defined in the specification for the scope `phone`.

.Client Scope Mappers
image:{project_images}/client-scopes-phone.png[]

When the `phone` client scope is linked to a client, that client automatically inherits all the protocol mappers defined in the
`phone` client scope. Access tokens issued for this client will contain the phone number information about the user, assuming that
the user has a defined phone number.

Builtin client scopes contain exactly the protocol mappers as defined per the specification,
however you are free to edit client scopes and create/update/remove any protocol mappers (or role scope mappings).

The client scope `roles` is not defined in the OpenID Connect specification and it is also not added automatically to the `scope`
claim in the access token. This client scope has some mappers, which are used to add roles of the user to the access token and
possibly add some audiences for the clients with at least one client role as described in the <<_audience_resolve, Audience section>>.

The client scope `web-origins` is also not defined in the OpenID Connect specification and not added to the `scope` claim. This is used
to add allowed web origins to the access token `allowed-origins` claim.

The client scope `microprofile-jwt` was created to handle the claims defined in the https://wiki.eclipse.org/MicroProfile/JWT_Auth[MicroProfile/JWT Auth Specification].
This client scope defines a user property mapper for the `upn` claim and also a realm role mapper for the `groups` claim. These mappers
can be changed as needed so that different properties can be used to create the MicroProfile/JWT specific claims.

==== Consent related settings

Client scope contains options related to the consent screen. Those options are useful only if the linked client is configured to
require consent (if the `Consent Required` switch is enabled on the client).

Display On Consent Screen::
  If on, and if this client scope is added to a client with consent required, then the text specified by `Consent Screen Text` will
  be displayed on the consent screen, which is shown once the user is authenticated and right before he is redirected from {project_name}
  to the client. If the switch is off, then this client scope will not be displayed on the consent screen.

Consent Screen Text::
  The text shown on the consent screen when this client scope is added to some client with consent required defaults to
  the name of client scope. The value for this text is localizable by specifying a substitution variable
  with `${var-name}` strings. The localized value is then configured within property files in your theme. See the
  link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information on localization.

[[_client_scopes_linking]]
==== Link Client Scope with the Client

Linking between client scope and client is configured in the `Client Scopes` tab of the particular client. There are 2 ways of
linking between client scope and client.

Default Client Scopes::
  This is applicable for both OpenID Connect and SAML clients. Default client scopes are always applied when issuing OpenID Connect tokens
  or SAML assertions for this client. The client will inherit Protocol mappers and Role Scope Mappings defined on the client
  scope. For the OpenID Connect Protocol, the Mappers and Role Scope Mappings are always applied, regardless of the value used for the scope
  parameter in the OpenID Connect authorization request.

Optional Client Scopes::
  This is applicable only for OpenID Connect clients. Optional client scopes are applied when issuing tokens for this client,
  but only when they are requested by the `scope` parameter in the OpenID Connect authorization request.

===== Example

For this example, we assume that the client has `profile` and `email` linked as default client scopes, and `phone` and `address`
are linked as optional client scopes. The client will use the value of the scope parameter when sending a request to the OpenID Connect authorization
endpoint:

```
scope=openid phone
```

The scope parameter contains the string, with the scope values divided by space (which is also the reason why a client scope name
cannot contain a space character in it). The value `openid` is the meta-value used for all OpenID Connect requests, so we will ignore
it for this example. The token will contain mappers and role scope mappings from the client scopes `profile`, `email` (which are
default scopes) and `phone` (an optional client scope requested by the scope parameter).

[[_client_scopes_evaluate]]
==== Evaluating Client Scopes

The tabs `Mappers` and `Scope` of the client contain the protocol mappers and role scope mappings declared solely for this client.
They do not contain the mappers and scope mappings inherited from client scopes. However, it may be useful to see what the
effective protocol mappers will be (protocol mappers defined on the client itself as well as inherited from the linked client scopes)
and the effective role scope mappings used when you generate the token for the particular client.

You can see all of these when you click the `Client Scopes` tab for the client and then open the sub-tab `Evaluate`. From here you
can select the optional client scopes that you want to apply. This will also show you the value of the `scope` parameter, which needs to
be sent from the application to the {project_name} OpenID Connect authorization endpoint.

.Evaluating Client Scopes
image:{project_images}/client-scopes-evaluate.png[]

NOTE: If you want to see how you can send a custom value for a `scope` parameter from your application, see the
link:{adapterguide_link}#_params_forwarding[parameters forwarding section], if your application uses the servlet adapter, or the
link:{adapterguide_link}#_javascript_adapter[javascript adapter section], if your application uses the javascript adapter.

===== Generating Example Tokens and User Info

If you select a user in the `Evaluate` screen, the following example data is generated:

* Generated Access Token: An access token that will be generated and sent to the client when the selected user is authenticated.
* Generated ID Token: An ID Token that will be generated and sent to the client when the selected user is authenticated.
* Generated User Info: The information about the user that is returned by the UserInfo Endpoint.

All examples are generated for the particular user and issued for the particular client, with the specified
value of `scope` parameter. The examples include all of the claims and role mappings used.

==== Client Scopes Permissions

When issuing tokens for a particular user, the client scope is applied only if the user is permitted to use it. In the case that
a client scope does not have any role scope mappings defined on itself, then each user is automatically permitted to use this
client scope. However, when a client scope has any role scope mappings defined on itself, then the user must be a member of at least
one of the roles. In other words, there must be an intersection between the user roles and the roles of the client scope. Composite
roles are taken into account when evaluating this intersection.

If a user is not permitted to use the client scope, then no protocol mappers or role scope mappings will be used when generating tokens
and the client scope will not appear in the _scope_ value in the token.

==== Realm Default Client Scopes

The `Realm Default Client Scopes` allow you to define set of client scopes, which will be automatically linked to newly created clients.

Open the left menu item `Client Scopes` and then select `Default Client Scopes`.

From here, select the client scopes that you want to add as `Default Client Scopes` to newly created clients and `Optional Client Scopes`
to newly created clients.

.Default Client Scopes

Once the client is created, you can unlink the default client scopes, if needed. This is similar to how you
remove <<_default_roles, Default Roles>>.

==== Scopes explained

The term `scope` is used in {project_name} on few places. Various occurrences of scopes are related to each other, but may have
a different context and meaning. To clarify, here we explain the various `scopes` used in {project_name}.

Client scope::
  Referenced in this chapter. Client scopes are entities in {project_name}, which are configured at the realm level and they can be
  linked to clients. The client scopes are referenced by their name when a request is sent to the {project_name} authorization endpoint
  with a corresponding value of the `scope` parameter. The details are described in the <<_client_scopes_linking, section about
  client scopes linking>>.

Role scope mapping::
  This can be seen when you open tab `Scope` of a client or client scope. Role scope mapping allows you to limit the roles which can
  be used in the access tokens. The details are described in the <<_role_scope_mappings, Role Scope Mappings section>>.

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]

Authorization scopes::
  This is used by the Authorization feature. The `Authorization Scope` is the action which can be done in the application.
  More details in the link:{authorizationguide_link}[Authorization Services Guide].
