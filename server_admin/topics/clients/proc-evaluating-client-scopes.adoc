[id="proc_evaluating_client_scopes_{context}"]

[role="_abstract"]
The `Mappers` tab contains the protocol mappers and the `Scope` tab contains the role scope mappings declared for this client. They do not contain the mappers and scope mappings inherited from client scopes. It is possible to see the effective protocol mappers (that is the protocol mappers defined on the client itself as well as inherited from the linked client scopes) and the effective role scope mappings used when generating a token for a client.

.Procedure
. Click the `Client Scopes` tab for the client.
. Open the sub-tab `Evaluate`. 
. Select the optional client scopes that you want to apply. 

This will also show you the value of the `scope` parameter. This parameter needs to be sent from the application to the {project_name} OpenID Connect authorization endpoint.

[NOTE]
====
To send a custom value for a `scope` parameter from your application, see the link:{adapterguide_link}#_params_forwarding[parameters forwarding section], for servlet adapters or the link:{adapterguide_link}#_javascript_adapter[javascript adapter section], for javascript adapters.
====

An example of a generated access token, specific to the user, client and `scope` parameter, is automatically generated under the `Generated Access Token` tab.
