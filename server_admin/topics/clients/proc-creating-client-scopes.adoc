[id="proc_creating_client_scopes_{context}"]

[role="_abstract"]
{project_name} allows you to define a shared client configuration in an entity called a _client scope_. This entity allows you to configure <<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_role_scope_mappings, role scope mappings>> for multiple clients.

Client scopes also support the OAuth 2 `scope` parameter. This parameter allows client applications to request more or fewer claims or roles in the access token, depending on the requirement of the application.

To create a client scope, follow these steps:

. Click `Client Scopes` in the left toolbar. 
+
.Client Scopes List

+
. Click `Create`. 
. Name your client scope.
. Click `Save`. 

A _client scope_ has similar tabs to regular clients. You can
define <<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_role_scope_mappings, role scope mappings>>. These mappings can be inherited by other clients and are configured to inherit from this client scope.
