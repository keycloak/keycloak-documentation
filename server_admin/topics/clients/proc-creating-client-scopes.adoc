. Click *Create*. 
. Name your client scope.
. Click *Save*. 

A _client scope_ has similar tabs to regular clients. You can
define <<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_role_scope_mappings, role scope mappings>>. These mappings can be inherited by other clients and are configured to inherit from this client scope.
