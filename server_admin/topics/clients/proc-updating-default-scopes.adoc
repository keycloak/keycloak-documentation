Use *Realm Default Client Scopes* to define sets of client scopes that are automatically linked to newly created clients.

.Procedure
. Click the *Client Scopes* tab for the client.
ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
. Click *Default Client Scopes*.
endif::[]

From here, select the client scopes that you want to add as *Default Client Scopes* to newly created clients and *Optional Client Scopes*.

When a client is created, you can unlink the default client scopes, if needed. This is similar to removing <<_default_roles, Default Roles>>.
