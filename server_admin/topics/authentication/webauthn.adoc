=== W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)

{project_name} provides the limited support for https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)]. {project_name} works as WebAuthn's https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#rp-operations[Relying Party (RP)].

IMPORTANT: Please note that WebAuthn support is still in development and not yet complete, so we recommend that you use this feature experimentally. Also, this support's specification and user interfaces may change.

NOTE: Whether WebAuthn's operations succeed depends on a user's WebAuthn supporting authenticator, browser and platform. If you use this WebAuthn support, please clarify to what extent those entities support the WebAuthn specification.

The major restriction is as follows :

- A user can register only one WebAuthn supporting Authenticator (called WebAuthn authenticator here).
- On registering the WebAuthn authenticator, its https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#attestation-statement[Attestation Statement] is not verified.
- Only the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) scenario is supported.

==== Setup

The setup procedure of WebAuthn support for 2FA is the following :

Enable User Registration::

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Realm Settings -> Login` tab.
- Set the `User Registration` to ON and click `Save`.

Enable Webauthn Authenticator Registration::

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> Required Actions` tab.
- Click `Register`.
- Select `Webauthn Register` as `Required Action`.
- Mark `Enabled` and `Default Action` checkbox.

Enable 2FA by Webauthn Authenticator::

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> Flows` tab.
- Copy and create the new browser flow.
- Add the `WebAuthn Authenticator` execution below the `User Password Form` execution.
- Set `REQUIRED` to the `WebAuthn Authenticator` execution's requirement.
- Open the `Authentication -> Bindings` tab.
- Select the created new browser flow as `Browser Flow`.
- Click `Save`.

==== Register WebAuthn Authenticator

The appropriate method to register a WebAuthen authenticator depends on if the user has or has not already registered an account on {project_name}.

User without their account::

A user carries out the following operations :

- Open the login form.
- Click the `Register` link.
- Fill in items on the register form and click `Register`.
- The user's browser asks the user to register their WebAuthn authenticator.
- After successful registration, the user's browser asks the user to enter the text as their just registered WebAuthn authenticator's label.

User with their account::

When such the users try to log in, they are required to register their WebAuthn authenticator automatically :

- Open the login form.
- Fill in items, click `Save` and  click `Login`.
- When the users log in, they are required to register their WebAuthn authenticator.
- After successful registration, the user's browser asks the user to enter the text as their just registered WebAuthn authenticator's label.
