[NOTE]
====
WebAuthn's operations success depends on the user's WebAuthn supporting authenticator, browser, and platform. Make sure your authenticator, browser, and platform support the WebAuthn specification.
====

==== Setup

The setup procedure of WebAuthn support for 2FA is the following :

[[_webauthn-register]]
===== Enable WebAuthn authenticator registration

. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Required Actions* tab.
. Click *Register*.
. Click the *Required Action* drop-down list.
. Click *Webauthn Register*.
. Click *Ok*.

Mark the *Default Action* checkbox if you want all new users to be required to register their WebAuthn credentials.

[[_webauthn-authenticator-setup]]
===== Adding WebAuthn authentication to a browser flow

. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Browser* flow.
. Click *Copy* to make a copy of the built-in *Browser* flow.
. Enter a name for the copy.
. Click *Ok*.
. Click the _Actions_ link for *WebAuthn Browser Browser - Conditional OTP* and click _Delete_.
. Click *Delete*.

If you require WebAuthn for all users:

. Click on the _Actions_ link for *WebAuthn Browser Forms*.

+
. Click the *Bindings* tab.
. Click the *Browser Flow* drop-down list.
. Click *WebAuthn Browser*.
. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
If a user does not have WebAuthn credentials, the user must register WebAuthn credentials.
====

Users can log in with WebAuthn if they have a WebAuthn credential registered only. So instead of adding the *WebAuthn Authenticator* execution, you can:

.Procedure
. Click on the _Actions_ link for *WebAuthn Browser Forms*.
. Click *Add flow*.
. Enter "Conditional 2FA" for the _Alias_ field.
. Click *Save*.
. Click _CONDITIONAL_ for *Conditional 2FA*

==== Authenticate with WebAuthn authenticator

After registering a WebAuthn authenticator, the user carries out the following operations:

* Open the login form. The user must authenticate with a username and password.
* The user's browser asks the user to authenticate by using their WebAuthn authenticator.

==== Managing WebAuthn as an administrator

===== Managing credentials

{project_name} manages WebAuthn credentials similarly to other credentials from xref:ref-user-credentials_{context}[User credential management]:

* {project_name} assigns users a required action to create a WebAuthn credential from the *Reset Actions* list and select *Webauthn Register*.
* Administrators can delete a WebAuthn credential by clicking *Delete*.
* Administrators can view the credential's data, such as the AAGUID, by selecting *Show data...*.
* Administrators can set a label for the credential by setting a value in the *User Label* field and saving the data.

[[_webauthn-policy]]
===== Managing policy

Administrators can configure WebAuthn related operations as *WebAuthn Policy* per realm.

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *WebAuthn Policy* tab.
. Configure the items within the policy (see description below).
. Click *Save*.

The configurable items and their description are as follows:

|===
|Configuration|Description

|Relying Party Entity Name
|The readable server name as a WebAuthn Relying Party. This item is mandatory and applies to the registration of the WebAuthn authenticator. The default setting is "keycloak". For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictionary-pkcredentialentity[WebAuthn Specification].

|Signature Algorithms
|The algorithms telling the WebAuthn authenticator which signature algorithms to use for the https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#iface-pkcredential[Public Key Credential]. {project_name} uses the Public Key Credential to sign and verify https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#authentication-assertion[Authentication Assertions]. If no algorithms exist, the default https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152#section-8.1[ES256] is adapted. ES256 is an optional configuration item applying to the registration of WebAuthn authenticators. For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictdef-publickeycredentialparameters[WebAuthn Specification].

|Relying Party ID
|The ID of a WebAuthn Relying Party that determines the scope of https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#public-key-credential[Public Key Credentials]. The ID must be the origin's effective domain. This ID is an optional configuration item applied to the registration of WebAuthn authenticators. If this entry is blank, {project_name} adapts the host part of {project_name}'s base URL. For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[WebAuthn Specification].

|Attestation Conveyance Preference
|The WebAuthn API implementation on the browser (https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#webauthn-client[WebAuthn Client]) is the preferential method to generate Attestation statements. This preference is an optional configuration item applying to the registration of the WebAuthn authenticator. If no option exists, its behavior is the same as selecting "none". For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[WebAuthn Specification].

|Authenticator Attachment
|The acceptable attachment pattern of a WebAuthn authenticator for the WebAuthn Client. This pattern is an optional configuration item applying to the registration of the WebAuthn authenticator. For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#enumdef-authenticatorattachment[WebAuthn Specification].

|Require Resident Key
|The option requiring that the WebAuthn authenticator generates the Public Key Credential as https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[Client-side-resident Public Key Credential Source]. This option applies to the registration of the WebAuthn authenticator. If left blank, its behavior is the same as selecting "No". For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dom-authenticatorselectioncriteria-requireresidentkey[WebAuthn Specification].

|User Verification Requirement
|The option requiring that the WebAuthn authenticator confirms the verification of a user. This is an optional configuration item applying to the registration of a WebAuthn authenticator and the authentication of a user by a WebAuthn authenticator. If no option exists, its behavior is the same as selecting "preferred". For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dom-authenticatorselectioncriteria-userverification[WebAuthn Specification for registering a WebAuthn authenticator] and https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dom-publickeycredentialrequestoptions-userverification[WebAuthn Specification for authenticating the user by a WebAuthn authenticator].

|Timeout
|The timeout value, in seconds, for registering a WebAuthn authenticator and authenticating the user by using a WebAuthn authenticator. If set to zero, its behavior depends on the WebAuthn authenticator's implementation. The default value is 0. For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dom-publickeycredentialcreationoptions-timeout[WebAuthn Specification for registering a WebAuthn authenticator] and https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dom-publickeycredentialrequestoptions-timeout[WebAuthn Specification for authenticating the user by a WebAuthn authenticator].

|Avoid Same Authenticator Registration
|If enabled, {project_name} cannot re-register an already registered WebAuthn authenticator.

|Acceptable AAGUIDs
|The white list of AAGUIDs which a WebAuthn authenticator must register against.

|===

==== Attestation statement verification

When registering a WebAuthn authenticator, {project_name} verifies the trustworthiness of the attestation statement generated by the WebAuthn authenticator. {project_name} requires the trust anchor's certificates for this. {project_name} uses the link:{installguide_truststore_link}[{installguide_truststore_name}], so you must import these certificates into it in advance.

To omit this validation, disable this truststore or set the WebAuthn policy's configuration item "Attestation Conveyance Preference" to "none".


==== Managing WebAuthn credentials as a user

===== Register WebAuthn authenticator

The appropriate method to register a WebAuthn authenticator depends on whether the user has already registered an account on {project_name}.

===== New user

If the *WebAuthn Register* required action is *Default Action* in a realm, new users must set up the WebAuthn security key after their first login.

.Procedure

. Open the login form.
. Click *Register*.
. Fill in the items on the form.
. Click *Register*.

After successfully registering, the browser asks the user to enter the text of their WebAuthn authenticator's label.

===== Existing user

If `WebAuthn Authenticator` is set up as required as shown in the first example, then when existing users try to log in, they are required to register their WebAuthn authenticator automatically:

.Procedure

. Open the login form.
. Enter the items on the form.
. Click *Save*.
. Click *Login*.

After successful registration, the user's browser asks the user to enter the text of their WebAuthn authenticator's label.

[[_webauthn_passwordless]]
==== Passwordless WebAuthn together with Two-Factor

{project_name} uses WebAuthn for two-factor authentication, but you can use WebAuthn as the first-factor authentication. In this case, users with `passwordless` WebAuthn credentials can authenticate to {project_name} without a password. {project_name} can use WebAuthn as both the passwordless and two-factor authentication mechanism in the context of a realm and a single authentication flow.

An administrator typically requires that Security Keys registered by users for the WebAuthn passwordless authentication meet different requirements. For example, the security keys may require users to authenticate to the security key using a PIN, or the security key attests with a stronger certificate authority.

Because of this, {project_name} permits administrators to configure a separate `WebAuthn Passwordless Policy`. There is a required `Webauthn Register Passwordless` action of type  and separate authenticator of type `WebAuthn Passwordless Authenticator`.

===== Setup

Set up WebAuthn passwordless support as follows:

. Register a new required action for WebAuthn passwordless support. Use the steps described in <<_webauthn-register, Enable WebAuthn Authenticator Registration>>. Register the `Webauthn Register Passwordless` action.

. Configure the policy. You can use the steps and configuration options described in <<_webauthn-policy, Managing Policy>>. Perform the configuration in the Admin Console in the tab *WebAuthn Passwordless Policy*. Typically the requirements for the security key will be stronger than for the two-factor policy. For example, you can set the *User Verification Requirement* to *Required* when you configure the passwordless policy.

. Configure the authentication flow. Use the *WebAuthn Browser* flow described in <<_webauthn-authenticator-setup, Adding WebAuthn Authentication to a Browser Flow>>. Configure the flow as follows:
+
** The *WebAuthn Browser Forms* subflow contains *Username Form* as the first authenticator. Delete the default *Username Password Form* authenticator and add the *Username Form* authenticator. This action requires the user to provide a username as the first step.
+
** There will be a required subflow, which can be named *Passwordless Or Two-factor*, for example. This subflow indicates the user can authenticate with Passwordless WebAuthn credential or with Two-factor authentication.
+
** The flow contains *WebAuthn Passwordless Authenticator* as the first alternative.
+
** The second alternative will be a subflow named *Password And Two-factor Webauthn*, for example. This subflow contains a *Password Form* and a *WebAuthn Authenticator*.

The final configuration of the flow looks similar to this:

image:images/webauthn-passwordless-flow.png[]

You can now add *WebAuthn Register Passwordless* as the required action to a user, already known to {project_name}, to test this. During the first authentication, the user must use the password and second-factor WebAuthn credential. The user does not need to provide the password and second-factor WebAuthn credential if they use the WebAuthn Passwordless credential.
