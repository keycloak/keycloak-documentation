=== W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)

{project_name} provides the limited support for https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)]. {project_name} works as a WebAuthn's https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#rp-operations[Relying Party (RP)].

IMPORTANT: Please note that WebAuthn support is still in development and not yet complete, so we recommend that you use this feature experimentally. Also, this support's specification and user interfaces may change.

NOTE: Whether WebAuthn's operations succeed depends on a user's WebAuthn supporting authenticator, browser and platform. If you use this WebAuthn support, please clarify to what extent those entities support the WebAuthn specification.

==== Setup

The setup procedure of WebAuthn support for 2FA is the following :

===== Enable User Registration

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Realm Settings -> Login` tab.
- Set the `User Registration` to ON and click `Save`.

===== Enable Webauthn Authenticator Registration

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> Required Actions` tab.
- Click `Register`.
- Select `Webauthn Register` as `Required Action`.
- Mark `Enabled` and `Default Action` checkbox.

===== Adding WebAuthn Authentication to a Browser Flow

* Select a realm, click on Authentication link, select the "Browser" flow
* Make a copy of the built-in "Browser" flow. You may want to give the new flow a distinctive name, for example "WebAuthn Browser"
* Using the drop down, select the copied flow
* Delete the `WebAuthn Browser Browser - Conditional OTP` sub-flow using its `Actions` menu

If you want to have WebAuthn required for all users:

* Using the `Actions` menu of the `WebAuthn Browser Forms`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `WebAuthn Authenticator` using the drop down and click on "Save"
* Set its Requirement to _Required_.

Note that in this scenario, if a user doesn't have a WebAuthn credential, a required action will be set that forces that user
to register one.

Alternatively, you can have users log in with WebAuthn only if they have a WebAuthn credential registered, so instead of adding
the `WebAuthn Authenticator` execution:

* Using the `Actions` menu of the `WebAuthn Browser Forms`, click on `Add flow`
* Set the alias to "Conditional 2FA"
* Set the Requirement of `Conditional 2FA` to _Conditional_
* Using the `Actions` menu of the `Conditional 2FA`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `Condition - User Configured` using the drop down and click on "Save"
* Using the `Actions` menu of the `Conditional 2FA`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `WebAuthn Authenticator` using the drop down and click on "Save"
* Set its Requirement to _Alternative_.

You can also allow the user to choose between using WebAuthn and OTP for his second factor:

* Using the `Actions` menu of the `Conditional 2FA`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `OTP Form` using the drop down and click on "Save"
* Set its Requirement to _Alternative_.

==== Authenticate with WebAuthn Authenticator

After registering their WebAuthn authenticator, the user carries out the following operations :

- Open the login form.
- Select the credential or credentials that {project_name} must accept for login. Then click `Save` and  click `Login`.
- The list of registered Webauthn Authenticators' labels appears. Click `Authenticate`.
- The user's browser asks the user to authenticate by their WebAuthn authenticator.

==== Managing WebAuthn as an administrator

===== Managing Credentials

WebAuthn credentials are managed in a similar manner as other credentials, such as OTP, from the <<user-credentials, User credential management>>:

* Users can be assigned a required action to create a WebAuthn credential from the `Reset Actions` list, and selecting `Webauthn Register`
* The administrator can delete a WebAuthn credential by pressing `Delete`.
* The administrator can view the credential's data such as the AAGUID by selecting `Show data...`.
* The administrator can set a label for the credential by setting a value in the `User Label` field and saving the data.

===== Managing Policy

An administrator can configure WebAuthn related operations as `WebAuthn Policy` per realm.

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> WebAuthn Policy` tab.
- Configure items and click `Save`.

The configurable items and their description follow.

|===
|Configuration|Description

|Relying Party Entity Name
|Human-readable server name as a WebAuthn Relying Party. This is a mandatory configuration, which is applied to the operation of registering the WebAuthn authenticator. The default setting is "keycloak".
 For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictionary-pkcredentialentity[WebAuthn Specification].

|Signature Algorithms
|It tells the WebAuthn authenticator which signature algorithms to use for the https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#public-key-credential[Public Key Credential] that can be used for signing and verifying the https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#authentication-assertion[Authentication Assertion]. Multiple algorithms can be specified. If no algorithm is specified, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152#section-8.1[ES256] is adapted. The default setting is ES256. This is an optional configuration item that is applied to the operation of registering a WebAuthn authenticator.
 For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictdef-publickeycredentialparameters[WebAuthn Specification].

|Relying Party ID

==== Attestation Statement Verification

When registering a WebAuthn authenticator, {project_name} verifies an attestation statement generated by this WebAuthn authenticator. On this verification process, {project_name} validates this attestation statement's trustworthiness. It requires trust anchor's certificates. {project_name} uses the link:{installguide_truststore_link}[{installguide_truststore_name}]  so that you need to import these certificates onto it in advance.

If you want to omit this attestation statement trustworthiness validation, please disable this truststore or set the WebAuthn policy's configuration item "Attestation Conveyance Preference" to "none".
