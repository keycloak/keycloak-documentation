NOTE: Whether WebAuthn's operations succeed depends on a user's WebAuthn supporting authenticator, browser and platform. If you use this WebAuthn support, please clarify to what extent those entities support the WebAuthn specification.

==== Setup

The setup procedure of WebAuthn support for 2FA is the following :

[[_webauthn-register]]
===== Enable Webauthn Authenticator Registration

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> Required Actions` tab.
- Click `Register`.
- Select `Webauthn Register` as `Required Action`.
- Mark `Enabled` checkbox. Optionally mark `Default Action` checkbox if you want all new created users to be required to register WebAuthn credential.

[[_webauthn-authenticator-setup]]
===== Adding WebAuthn Authentication to a Browser Flow

* Select a realm, click on `Authentication` link, select the `Browser` flow
* Make a copy of the built-in "Browser" flow. You may want to give the new flow a distinctive name, for example "WebAuthn Browser"
* Using the drop down, select the copied flow
* Delete the `WebAuthn Browser Browser - Conditional OTP` sub-flow using its `Actions` menu

If you want to have WebAuthn required for all users:

* Using the `Actions` menu of the `WebAuthn Browser Forms`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `WebAuthn Authenticator` using the drop down and click on `Save`
* Set its Requirement to _Required_.

image:images/webauthn-browser-flow-required.png[]

* In the `Bindings` menu, change the browser flow to `WebAuthn Browser`

Note that in this scenario, if a user doesn't have a WebAuthn credential, a required action will be set that forces that user
to register one.

Alternatively, you can have users log in with WebAuthn only if they have a WebAuthn credential registered, so instead of adding
the `WebAuthn Authenticator` execution:

* Using the `Actions` menu of the `WebAuthn Browser Forms`, click on `Add flow`
* Set the alias to "Conditional 2FA" and click on `Save`
* Set the Requirement of `Conditional 2FA` to _Conditional_
* Using the `Actions` menu of the `Conditional 2FA`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `Condition - User Configured` using the drop down and click on `Save`
* Set the Requirement of `Condition - User Configured` execution to _Required_
* Using the `Actions` menu of the `Conditional 2FA`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `WebAuthn Authenticator` using the drop down and click on `Save`
* Set its Requirement to _Alternative_.

image:images/webauthn-browser-flow-conditional.png[]

You can also allow the user to choose between using WebAuthn and OTP for his second factor:

* Using the `Actions` menu of the `Conditional 2FA`, click on `Add execution`
* Select `OTP Form` using the drop down and click on `Save`
* Set its Requirement to _Alternative_.

==== Authenticate with WebAuthn Authenticator

After registering a WebAuthn authenticator, the user carries out the following operations
assuming that authentication flow configuration above with the conditional subflow using `WebAuthn Authenticator` was used:

- Open the login form. The user must authenticate with a username and password.
- The user's browser asks the user to authenticate by their WebAuthn authenticator.

==== Managing WebAuthn as an administrator

===== Managing Credentials

WebAuthn credentials are managed in a similar manner as other credentials, such as OTP, from the <<_user-credentials, User credential management>>:

* Users can be assigned a required action to create a WebAuthn credential from the `Reset Actions` list, and selecting `Webauthn Register`
* The administrator can delete a WebAuthn credential by pressing `Delete`.
* The administrator can view the credential's data such as the AAGUID by selecting `Show data...`.
* The administrator can set a label for the credential by setting a value in the `User Label` field and saving the data.

[[_webauthn-policy]]
===== Managing Policy

An administrator can configure WebAuthn related operations as `WebAuthn Policy` per realm.

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> WebAuthn Policy` tab.
- Configure items and click `Save`.

The configurable items and their description follow.

|===
|Configuration|Description

|Relying Party Entity Name
|Human-readable server name as a WebAuthn Relying Party. This is a mandatory configuration, which is applied to the operation of registering the WebAuthn authenticator. The default setting is "keycloak".
 For more details, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictionary-pkcredentialentity[WebAuthn Specification].

==== Attestation Statement Verification

When registering a WebAuthn authenticator, {project_name} verifies an attestation statement generated by this WebAuthn authenticator. On this verification process, {project_name} validates this attestation statement's trustworthiness. It requires trust anchor's certificates. {project_name} uses the link:{installguide_truststore_link}[{installguide_truststore_name}]  so that you need to import these certificates onto it in advance.

If you want to omit this attestation statement trustworthiness validation, please disable this truststore or set the WebAuthn policy's configuration item "Attestation Conveyance Preference" to "none".


==== Managing WebAuthn credentials as a user

===== Register WebAuthn Authenticator

The appropriate method to register a WebAuthn authenticator depends on if the user has or has not already registered an account on {project_name}.

New user::

If the `WebAuthn Register` required action is set as `Default Action` in a realm, new users are required to
set up the WebAuthn security key after the first successful login. A new user carries out the following operations :

- Open the login form.
- Click the `Register` link.
- Fill in items on the register form and click `Register`.
- The user's browser asks the user to register their WebAuthn authenticator.
- After successful registration, the user's browser asks the user to enter the text as their just registered WebAuthn authenticator's label.

Existing user::

If `WebAuthn Authenticator` is set up as required as shown in the first example, then when existing users try to log in,
they are required to register their WebAuthn authenticator automatically :

- Open the login form.
- Fill in items, click `Save` and  click `Login`.
- When the users log in, they are required to register their WebAuthn authenticator.
- After successful registration, the user's browser asks the user to enter the text as their just registered WebAuthn authenticator's label.

==== Passwordless WebAuthn together with Two-Factor

WebAuthn is often used for two-factor authentication, however it can be desired to use it also as first factor authentication. In this case,
a user with `passwordless` WebAuthn credential will be able to authenticate to {project_name} without a password. {project_name} allows to use WebAuthn
as both the passwordless and two-factor authentication mechanism in the context of a single realm and even in the context of a single authentication flow.

Administrator may typically require that Security Keys registered by users for the WebAuthn passwordless authentication must meet different
(usually stronger) requirements. For example, those security keys may require users to authenticate to that security key using a PIN, or the
security key should be attested with stronger certificate authority.

Because of this situation, {project_name} allows administrator to configure separate `WebAuthn Passwordless Policy`. There is a separate required action
of type `Webauthn Register Passwordless` and separate authenticator of type `WebAuthn Passwordless Authenticator`.

===== Setup

The setup procedure of WebAuthn passwordless support is the following :

* Register new required action for WebAuthn passwordless support. Use the same steps as described <<_webauthn-register, above>>
with the only difference, that you need to register the action called `Webauthn Register Passwordless`.

* Configure the policy. You can use same steps and configuration options as described <<_webauthn-policy, above>>, however you
need to configure them in the admin console in the tab `WebAuthn Passwordless Policy`. You can configure this policy as you want, however
typically the requirements for the security key will be stronger than for the two-factor policy. For example the `User Verification Requirement` can
be set to `Required` when you configure the passwordless policy.

* Finally configure the authentication flow. Let's assume that we will use same flow called `WebAuthn Browser` as described
<<_webauthn-authenticator-setup, above>>, but
we will configure it as follows:

** The `WebAuthn Browser Forms` subflow will contain `Username Form` as the first authenticator. Delete the default `Username Password Form`
authenticator and add the `Username Form` authenticator instead. This setting means that the user will provide just his or her username as the first step.

** There will be a required subflow, which can be named for example `Passwordless Or Two-factor` . This setting indicates that user can
authenticate either with Passwordless WebAuthn credential or with Two-factor authentication.

** Flow will contain `WebAuthn Passwordless Authenticator` as the first alternative.

** The second alternative will be a subflow named for example `Password And Two-factor Webauthn`. This subflow will contain a `Password Form` and
a `WebAuthn Authenticator`.

The final configuration of the flow will look like the following:

image:images/webauthn-passwordless-flow.png[]

You can now add `WebAuthn Register Passwordless` as the required action to some user, already known to {project_name}, to test this.
During the first authentication, the user will be still required to use the password and second-factor WebAuthn credential. However, once
the user registers the credentials, that user will be able
to choose during future authentications. If he uses  his or her WebAuthn Passwordless credential, he won't need to
provide the password and second-factor WebAuthn credential at all.
