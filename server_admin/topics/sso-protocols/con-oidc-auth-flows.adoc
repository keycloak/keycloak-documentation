==== OIDC Auth Flows
[role="_abstract"]
OIDC has several methods, or flows, that clients or applications can use to authenticate users and receive _identity_ and _access_ tokens.  The method depends on the type of application or client requesting access.

[[_oidc-auth-flows-authorization]]

===== Authorization Code Flow

The Authorization Code Flow is a browser-based protocol and suits authenticating and authorizing browser-based applications. It uses browser redirects to obtain _identity_ and _access_ tokens.

. A user connects to an application using a browser. The application detects the user is not logged into the application.
. The application redirects the browser to {project_name} for authentication.
. The application passes a callback URL as a query parameter in the browser redirect. {project_name} uses the parameter upon successful authentication.
. {project_name} authenticates the user and creates a one-time, short lived, temporary code.
. {project_name} redirects to the application using the callback URL and adds the temporary code as a query parameter in the callback URL.
. The application extracts the temporary code and makes a background REST invocation to {project_name}
to exchange the code for an _identity_ and _access_ and _refresh_ token.  To prevent replay attacks, the temporary code cannot be used more than once.

[NOTE]
====
A system is vulnerable to a stolen token for the lifetime of that token. For security and scalability reasons, access_ tokens are generally set to expire quickly so subsequent token requests fail. If a token expires, an application can obtain a new access token using the additional _refresh_ token sent by the login protocol. 
====

[[_confidential-clients]]
_Confidential_ clients provide client secrets when they exchange the temporary codes for tokens. _Public_ clients are not required to provide client secrets.
_Public_ clients are secure when HTTPS is strictly enforced and redirect URIs registered for the client are strictly controlled.  HTML5/JavaScript clients have to be _public_ clients because there is no way to securely transmit the client secret to HTML5/JavaScript clients. For more details, see the xref:assembly-managing-clients_{context}[Managing Clients] chapter.

{project_name} also supports the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[Proof Key for Code Exchange] specification.

[[_oidc-auth-flows-implicit]]

===== Implicit Flow

The Implicit Flow is a browser-based protocol. It is similar to the Authorization Code Flow but with fewer requests and no refresh tokens. 

[NOTE]
====
The possibility exists of _access_ tokens leaking in the browser history when tokens are transmitted via redirect URIs (see below).

Also, this flow does not provide clients with refresh tokens. Therefore, access tokens have to be long-lived or users  have to re-authenticate when they expire.  

We do not advise using this flow. This flow is supported because it is in the OIDC and OAuth 2.0 specification.
====

The protocol works as follows:

. A user connects to an application using a browser. The application detects the user is not logged into the application.
. The application redirects the browser to {project_name} for authentication.
. The application passes a callback URL as a query parameter in the browser redirect. {project_name} uses the query parameter upon successful authentication.
. {project_name} authenticates the user and creates an _identity_ and _access_ token. {project_name}
redirects to the application using the callback URL and additionally adds the _identity_ and _access_ tokens as a query parameter in the callback URL.
. The application extracts the _identity_ and _access_ tokens from the callback URL.

[[_oidc-auth-flows-direct]]

===== Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Direct Access Grants)

_Direct Access Grants_ are used by REST clients to obtain tokens on behalf of users.  It is a HTTP POST request that contains:

* The credentials of the user. The credentials are sent within form parameters.
* The id of the client.
* The clients secret (if it is a confidential client).

The HTTP response contains the _identity_, _access_, and _refresh_ tokens.

[[_client_credentials_grant]]
===== Client Credentials Grant

The _Client Credentials Grant_ creates a token based on the metadata and permissions of a service account associated with the client instead of obtaining a token that works on behalf of an external user. _Client Credentials Grants_ are used by REST clients.

See the <<_service_accounts,Service Accounts>> chapter for more information.

===== Device Authorization Grant

This is used by clients running on internet-connected devices that have limited input capabilities or lack a suitable browser. Here's a brief summary of the protocol:

. The application requests {project_name} a device code and a user code. {project_name} creates a device code and a user code. {project_name} returns a response including the device code and the user code to the application.
. The application provides the user with the user code and the verification URI. The user accesses a verification URI to be authenticated by using another browser.
. The application repeatedly polls {project_name} to find out if the user completed the user authorization. If user authentication is complete, the application exchanges the device code for an _identity_, _access_ and _refresh_ token.

[[_client_initiated_backchannel_authentication_grant]]
===== Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Grant

:tech_feature_name: Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Grant
:tech_feature_setting: -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.ciba=enabled
include::../templates/techpreview.adoc[]

This is used by clients who want to initiate the authentication flow by communicating with the OpenID Provider directly without redirect through the user's browser like OAuth 2.0's authorization code grant. Here's a brief summary of the protocol:

. The client requests {project_name} an auth_req_id that identifies the authentication request made by the client. {project_name} creates the auth_req_id.
. After receiving this auth_req_id, this client repeatedly needs to poll {project_name} to obtain an Access Token, Refresh Token and ID Token from {project_name} in return for the auth_req_id until the user is authenticated. 

An administrator can configure Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) related operations as `CIBA Policy` per realm.

Also please refer to other places of {project_name} documentation like link:{adapterguide_link}#_backchannel_authentication_endpoint[Backchannel Authentication Endpoint section] of {adapterguide_name} and link:{adapterguide_link}#_client_initiated_backchannel_authentication_grant[Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Grant section] of {adapterguide_name}.

====== CIBA Policy

An administrator carries out the following operations on the `Admin Console` :

- Open the `Authentication -> CIBA Policy` tab.
- Configure items and click `Save`.

The configurable items and their description follow.

|===
|Configuration|Description

|Backchannel Token Delivery Mode
|Specifying how the CD (Consumption Device) gets the authentication result and related tokens. There are three modes, "poll", "ping" and "push". {project_name} only supports "poll". The default setting is "poll". This configuration is required.
 For more details, see https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.5[CIBA Specification].

|Expires In
|The expiration time of the "auth_req_id" in seconds since the authentication request was received. The default setting is 120. This configuration is required.
 For more details, see https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#successful_authentication_request_acknowdlegment[CIBA Specification].

|Interval
|The interval in seconds the CD (Consumption Device) needs to wait for between polling requests to the token endpoint. The default setting is 5. This configuration is optional.
 For more details, see https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#successful_authentication_request_acknowdlegment[CIBA Specification].

|Authentication Requested User Hint
|The way of identifying the end-user for whom authentication is being requested. The default setting is "login_hint".  There are three modes, "login_hint", "login_hint_token" and "id_token_hint". {project_name} only supports "login_hint". This configuration is required.
 For more details, see https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.7.1[CIBA Specification].

|===

====== Provider Setting

The CIBA grant uses the following two providers.

. Authentication Channel Provider : provides the communication between {project_name} and the entity that actually authenticates the user via AD (Authentication Device).
. User Resolver Provider : get `UserModel` of {project_name} from the information provided by the client to identify the user.

{project_name} has both default providers. However, the administrator needs to set up Authentication Channel Provider like this:

[source,xml]
----
<spi name="ciba-auth-channel">
    <default-provider>ciba-http-auth-channel</default-provider>
    <provider name="ciba-http-auth-channel" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="httpAuthenticationChannelUri" value="https://backend.internal.example.com/auth"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

The configurable items and their description follow.

|===
|Configuration|Description

|httpAuthenticationChannelUri
|Specifying URI of the entity that actually authenticates the user via AD (Authentication Device).

|===

====== Authentication Channel Provider

CIBA standard document does not specify how to authenticate the user by AD. Therefore, it might be implemented at the discretion of products. {project_name} delegates this authentication to an external authentication entity. To communicate with the authentication entity, {project_name} provides Authentication Channel Provider.

Its implementation of {project_name} assumes that the authentication entity is under the control of the administrator of {project_name} so that {project_name} trusts the authentication entity. It is not recommended to use the authentication entity that the administrator of {project_name} cannot control.

Authentication Channel Provider is provided as SPI provider so that users of {project_name} can implement their own provider in order to meet their environment. {project_name} provides its default provider called HTTP Authentication Channel Provider that uses HTTP to communicate with the authentication entity.

If a user of {project_name} user want to use the HTTP Authentication Channel Provider, they need to know its contract between {project_name} and the authentication entity consisting of the following two parts.

Authentication Delegation Request/Response:: 
{project_name} sends an authentication request to the authentication entity.

Authentication Result Notification/ACK:: 
The authentication entity notifies the result of the authentication to {project_name}.

Authentication Delegation Request/Response consists of the following messaging.

Authentication Delegation Request:: The request is sent from {project_name} to the authentication entity to ask it for user authentication by AD.

====== User Resolver Provider

Even if the same user, its representation may differ in each CD, {project_name} and the authentication entity.

For CD, {project_name} and the authentication entity to recognize the same user, this User Resolver Provider converts their own user representations among them.

User Resolver Provider is provided as SPI provider so that users of {project_name} can implement their own provider in order to meet their environment. {project_name} provides its default provider called Default User Resolver Provider that has the following characteristics.

* Only support `login_hint` parameter and is used as default.
* `username` of UserModel in {project_name} is used to represent the user on CD, {project_name} and the authentication entity.
