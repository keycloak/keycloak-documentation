=== OpenID Connect vs. SAML
[role="_abstract"]
The following lists a number of factors to consider when choosing a protocol.

For most purposes, {project_name} recommends using OIDC.

*OIDC*

* OIDC is specifically designed to work with the web.  
* OIDC is suited for HTML5/JavaScript applications because it is easier to implement on the client side than SAML.
* OIDC tokens are in the JSON format which makes them easier for Javascript to consume. 
* OIDC has features to make security implementation easier. For example, see the link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#ChangeNotification[iframe trick] that the specification uses to determine a users login status.

*SAML*

* SAML is designed as a layer to work on top of the web.
* SAML can be more verbose than OIDC.
* Users pick SAML over OIDC because there is a perception that it is mature.
* Users pick SAML over OIDC existing applications that are secured with it.
