=== Realm Roles

Realm-level roles are a global namespace to define your roles. You can see the list of built-in and created roles by clicking the `Roles` left menu item.

The value for the `description` field is localizable by specifying a substitution variable with `$\{var-name}` strings. The localized
value is then configured within property files in your theme. See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information
on localization.
