[[_ssl_modes]]

= Configuring SSL for a realm

Each realm has an associated SSL Mode, which defines the SSL/HTTPS requirements for interacting with the realm.
Browsers and applications that interact with the realm honor the SSL/HTTPS requirements defined by the SSL Mode or they cannot interact with the server.

. Set *Require SSL* to one of the following SSL modes:

* *External requests*
  Users can interact with {project_name} without SSL so long as they stick to private IP addresses such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, and `172.16.x.x`.
  If you try to access {project_name} without SSL from a non-private IP address, you will get an error.

* *None*
  {project_name} does not require SSL.  This choice applies only in development when you are experimenting and do not plan to support this deployment.

* *All requests*
  {project_name} requires SSL for all IP addresses.
