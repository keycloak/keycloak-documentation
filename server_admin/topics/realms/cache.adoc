[[_clear-cache]]
= Clearing server caches

{project_name} caches everything it can in memory within the limits of your JVM and the limits you have configured.  If the {project_name} database is modified by a third party, such as a DBA, outside the scope of the server's REST APIs or Admin Console, parts of the in-memory cache could be stale.  You can clear the realm cache, user cache or cache of external public keys, such as Public keys of
 external clients or Identity providers, which {project_name} may use to verify signatures of particular external entity.

.Procedure

. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu.

. Click the *Cache* tab.

. Click *Clear* for the cache you want to evict.
