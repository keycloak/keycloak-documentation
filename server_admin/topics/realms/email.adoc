As emails are used for recovering usernames and passwords it's recommended to use SSL or TLS, especially if the SMTP server is on an external network.
To enable SSL click on `Enable SSL` or to enable TLS click on `Enable TLS`.
You will most likely also need to change the `Port` (the default port for SSL/TLS is 465).

If your SMTP server requires authentication click on `Enable Authentication` and insert the `Username` and `Password`. The value of the `Password` field can refer a value from an external <<_vault-administration,vault>>.
