== User Account Service

{project_name} has a built-in User Account Service which every user has access to.  This service allows users to manage their account,
change their credentials, update their profile, and view their login sessions.  The URL to this service is `<server-root>/auth/realms/{realm-name}/account`.

The initial page is the user's profile, which is the `Account` left menu item.  This is where they specify basic data about themselves.  This screen can be extended
to allow the user to manage additional attributes.  See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more details.

The `Password` left menu item allows the user to change their password.

The `Authenticator` menu item allows the user to set up OTP if they desire.  This will only show up if OTP is a valid authentication mechanism for your realm.
Users are given directions to install https://freeotp.github.io/[FreeOTP] or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2[Google Authenticator] on their mobile device to be their OTP generator.
The QR code you see in the screen shot can be scanned into the FreeOTP or Google Authenticator mobile application for nice and easy setup.

The `Federated Identity` menu item allows the user to link their account with an <<_identity_broker, identity broker>> (this is usually used to link social provider
accounts together).  This will show the list of external identity providers you have configured for your realm.
