== Enabling Remember Me

A logged-in user closing their browser destroys their session, and that user must log in again. You can set {project_name} to keep the user's login session open if that user clicks the _Remember Me_ checkbox upon login. This action turns the login cookie from a session-only cookie to a persistence cookie.

.Procedure
. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Login* tab.
. Toggle the *Remember Me* switch to *ON*.

When you save this setting, a `remember me` checkbox displays on the realm's login page.
