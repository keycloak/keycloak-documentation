== Enabling forgot password

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]

ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
A `forgot password` link displays in your login pages.

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]

. Click this link to bring users where they can enter their username or email address and receive an email with a link to reset their credentials.

The text sent in the email is configurable. See link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

When users click the email link, {project_name} asks them to update their password, and if they have set up an OTP generator, {project_name} asks them to reconfigure the OTP generator.  Depending on security requirements of your organization, you may not want users to reset their OTP generator through email. 

To change this behavior, perform these steps:

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Flows* tab.
. Select the *Reset Credentials* flow.

If you do not want to reset the OTP, set the `Reset OTP` requirement to *Disabled*.
