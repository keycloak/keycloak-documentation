=== Forgot Password

If you enable `Forgot Password`, users can reset their login credentials if they forget their password or lose their OTP generator. 

.Procedure
. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Login* tab.

A `forgot password` link displays in your login pages.

Click this link to bring users where they can enter their username or email address and receive an email with a link to reset their credentials.

The text sent in the email is configurable. See link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

When users click the email link, {project_name} asks them to update their password, and if they have set up an OTP generator, {project_name} asks them to reconfigure the OTP generator.  Depending on security requirements of your organization, you may not want users to reset their OTP generator through email. 

To change this behavior:

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Flows* tab.
. Select the *Reset Credentials* flow.

If you do not want to reset the OTP, set the `Reset OTP` requirement to *Disabled*.
. Click the *Required Actions* tab. Ensure _Update Password_ is enabled.
