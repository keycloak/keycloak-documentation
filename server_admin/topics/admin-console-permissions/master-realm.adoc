=== Master realm access control

The `master` realm in {project_name} is a special realm and treated differently than other realms.
Users in the {project_name} `master` realm can be granted permission to manage zero or more realms that are deployed on the {project_name} server.
When a realm is created, {project_name} automatically creates various roles that grant fine-grain permissions to access that new realm.
Access to The Admin Console and Admin REST endpoints can be controlled by mapping these roles to users in the `master` realm.
It's possible to create multiple super users,  as well as users that can only manage specific realms.

==== Global roles

There are two realm-level roles in the `master` realm.
These are: 

* admin
* create-realm        

Users with the `admin` role are super users and have full access to manage any realm on the server.  Users with the `create-realm` role
are allowed to create new realms.  They will be granted full access to any new realm they create.

==== Realm specific roles

Admin users within the `master` realm can be granted management privileges to one or more other realms in the system.
Each realm in {project_name} is represented by a client in the `master` realm.
The name of the client is `<realm name>-realm`.  These clients each have client-level roles defined which define varying
level of access to manage an individual realm.

The roles available are: 

* view-realm
* view-users
* view-clients
* view-events
* manage-realm
* manage-users
* create-client
* manage-clients
* manage-events            
* view-identity-providers
* manage-identity-providers
* impersonation

Assign the roles you want to your users and they will only be able to use that specific part of the administration console.

IMPORTANT: Admins with the `manage-users` role will only be able to assign admin roles to users that they themselves have.  So, if an admin has the `manage-users` role but doesn't have the `manage-realm` role, they will not be able to assign this role.
