=== Fine Grain Admin Permissions

[NOTE]
====
Fine Grain Admin Permissions are *Technology Preview* and are not supported. {project_name} disables Fine Grain Admin Permissions by default.

To enable Fine Grain Admin Permissions, start the server with the `--Dkeycloak.profile.feature.admin_fine_grained_authz=enabled` parameter.

For more details see link:{installguide_profile_link}[{installguide_profile_name}].
====

The permissions in roles such as `manage-realm` or `manage-users` are too generalised for some users. In {project_name}, you can define and assign fine grain restricted access policies for managing a realm. Examples include:

* Managing a specific client.
* Managing users in a specific group.
* Managing group membership.
* Limited user management.
* Fine grain impersonation control.
* Assigning a specific set of roles to users.
* Assigning a specific set of roles to a composite role.
* Assigning a specific set of roles to a client's scope.
* General policies for managing users, groups, roles, and clients.

{project_name} implements fine grain admin permissions on top of link:{authorizationguide_link}[Authorization Services].

Fine grain permissions are available within <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin consoles>> and available to administrators defined in those realms only. You cannot define cross-realm fine grain permissions.

Use fine grain permissions to grant additional permissions.  You cannot override the default behaviour of the built-in admin roles.

==== Managing One Specific Client

In this example, we use a realm named `test` and a client named `sales-application`. In the `test` realm, we give a user permission to manage the `sales-application` only.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Administrators in the `master` realm are limited to the predefined admin roles defined in previous chapters.
====

.Procedure
. Ensure Fine Grain Admin Permissions are enabled.
. Login to the Admin Console.
. Click *Clients* in the menu.
. Select your client.
+
.Client Management
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-client.png[]
+
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
+
.Client Permissions Tab
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-client-permissions-tab-off.png[]
+
. Toggle *Permissions Enabled* to *ON*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Toggling *Permissions Enabled* to *OFF* deletes all the defined permissions of the client.
====
+
.Client Permissions Tab

Enabling *Permissions Enabled* initializes permission objects using link:{authorizationguide_link}[Authorization Services]. All authorization objects are contained in the `realm-management` client's `Authorization` tab.

In this example, we are creating a `User Policy` for the `manage` permission. Upon initialization, the `manage` permission has no policies associated with it. Create these policies.

.Procedure
. Click the `manage` permission. 
+
.Client Manage Permission
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-client-manage-permissions.png[]
+
. Click the `Authorization`.
. Click the *Policies* tab.
. Click the *Create Policy* drop-down menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use this menu to associate a policy with a role, group or rules defined in Javascript.
====
+
. Enter `sales-app-admin` in the *Name* field.
. Select the `sales-admin` user in the *users* list.
. Click *Save*.
+
User Policy
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-client-user-policy.png[]
+
. Click *Clients* in the menu.
. Select your client.
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
. Click the `manage` permission. 
. Click the *Apply Policy* drop-down menu.
. Select `Sales-app-admin`.
+
.Assign User Policy
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-client-assign-user-policy.png[]
+
. Click *Save*.
+
The `sales-admin` user now has permission to manage the `sales-application` client.
+
. Click *Users* in the menu.
. Select the `sales-admin` user.
. Click the *Role Mappings* tab.
. In *Client Roles* > *Available Roles*, click `query-clients`.
. Click *Add Selected* to move `query-clients` to the *Assigned Roles* section.
+
.Assign query-clients
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-assign-query-clients.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `query-clients` role must be assigned to `sales-admin` so the Admin Console renders client menus for the `sales-admin` user. If the `query-clients` role is unset, restricted admins do not see any menu options when they log into the Admin Console.
====

To test this:

.Procedure
. Log out of the master realm.
. Log in to the <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin console>> for the `test` realm as the `sales-admin` user. The <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin console>> is located under `/auth/admin/test/console`.
+
.Sales Admin Login
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-sales-admin-login.png[]

This admin can now manage this one client.

==== Restrict User Role Mapping

It is possible, through fine grain permissions, to restrict the roles an admin can assign to users. In this example, we specifically restrict the `sales-admin` user to:

* Assign roles that grant specific access to the `sales-application`.
* Map roles.

The `sales-application` has three client roles.

* viewLeads
* leader-creator
* admin

.Sales Application Roles
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-sales-application-roles.png[]

.Procedure
. Click *Clients* in the menu.
. Select your client.
. Click the *Roles* tab.
. Click the `viewleads` role.
+
.View Leads Role Permission Tab
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-view-leads-role-tab.png[]
+
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
. Toggle *Permissions Enabled* to *ON*
+
.View Leads Permissions
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-view-leads-permissions.png[]
+
. Click `map-role`.
+
.Map-roles Permission
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-map-roles-permission.png[]
+
. Click the *Apply Policy* drop-down menu.
. Select `Sales-app-admin`.
. Click *Save*.

The `sales-admin` user can now map the `viewleads` role to other users. Next, we specify the users the `sales-admin` can map the role to.

.Procedure
. Click *Users* in the menu.
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
. Toggle *Permissions Enabled* to *ON*
+
.Users Permissions
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-users-permissions.png[]
+
. Click `map-roles`.
. Click the *Apply Policy* drop-down menu.
. Select `Sales-app-admin`.
. Click *Save*.

Last, add the `view-users` role to the `sales-admin`. With this role, admins can now view users in the realm.

.Procedure
. Click *Users* in the menu.
. Select the `sales-admin` user.
. Click the *Role Mappings* tab.
. In *Client Roles*, select `view-users` under *Available Roles*.
. Click *Add Selected* to move `query-clients` to the *Assigned Roles* section.
+
.Add view-users
image:{project_images}/fine-grain-add-view-users.png[]

To test this:

.Procedure
. Log out of the master realm.
. Log in to the <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin console>> for the `test` realm as the `sales-admin` user. The <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin console>> is located under `/auth/admin/test/console`.

The `sales-admin` can now view users in the system. Clicking a specific user shows that each user detail is read-only, except the `Role Mappings` tab. Clicking this tab shows no `Available` roles for the admin to map users to except that browsing the `sales-application` roles as `sales-admin` can map the `viewLeads` role only.

===== Per Client map-roles Shortcut

A short way to map roles is to grant access to the `map-roles` to an admin. Admins can then map any role defined by the client.

==== Full List of Permissions

This chapter defines the list of permission types that can be described for a realm.

===== Role

The `Permissions` tab for each role lists the following permission types.

====== map-role
Controls an admin mapping this role to a user. `map-role` policies specify that the role can be mapped to a user only. `map-role` policies do not specify that an admin can perform user role mapping tasks.  The admin must have manage or role mapping permissions also.  See <<_users-permissions, Users Permissions>> for more information.

====== map-role-composite
Controls an admin mapping this role as a composite to another role. An admin can define client roles if the client manages permissions for that client. An admin cannot add composites to those roles unless the admin has `map-role-composite` privileges for the role he wants to add as a composite.

====== map-role-client-scope
Controls an admin applying this role to the scope of a client. Even if the admin can manage the client, the admin will be unable to create tokens for a client that contains this role unless this permission is specifically granted.

===== Client

Each clients `Permissions` tab lists the following permission types.

====== view
Policies covering an admin's view of the client's configuration.

====== manage
Policies covering the viewing and management of client's configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Privileges can be leaked unintentionally using this policy. For example, an admin can define a protocol mapper that hardcodes roles even when the admin does not have privileges to map roles to the client's scope. 

This issue is currently a limitation of protocol mappers. They cannot assign individual permissions as roles do.
====

====== configure
A reduced set of privileges for client management.  It is similar to the `manage` scope except the admin is unable to:

* Define protocol mappers.
* Change the client template.
* Change the client's scope.

====== map-roles
Policies covering if admins can map a role defined by the client to a user. This feature avoids defining policies for each client defined role.

====== map-roles-composite
Policies covering if admins can map a role defined by the client as a composite to another role. This feature avoids defining policies for each client defined role.

====== map-roles-client-scope::
Policies covering if admins can map a role defined by the client to the scope of another client. This feature avoids defining policies for each client defined role.

[[_users-permissions]]
===== Users

Each user `Permissions` tab lists the following permission types.

====== view
Policies covering if admins can view all users in the realm.

===== manage
Policies covering if admins can manage users in the realm. This permission grants admins the privilege to perform user role mappings. It does not specify the roles the admin can map. Define the privilege for each role the admin can map.

===== map-roles
A subset of the privileges granted by the `manage` scope. In this case the ability to map roles. The admin cannot perform any other user management operation. This role is similar to the `manage` role. For client roles, the roles the admin applies must be specified per role, or set of roles.

===== manage-group-membership
This permissions type is similar to `map-roles` but covers group membership. These policies grant the admin permission to manage group membership but not the groups the admin is allowed to manage membership for. Specify policies for each group's `manage-members` permission.

===== impersonate
Policies covering if an admin can impersonate other users. These policies apply to the admin's attributes and role mappings.

===== user-impersonated
Policies covering the users that can be impersonated. These policies are applied to the user being impersonated.  For example, defining policies that forbid users from impersonating a user that has admin privileges.

===== Group

Each groups `Permissions` tab lists the following permission types.

===== view
Policies covering if an admin can view information about the group.

===== manage
Policies covering if an admin can manage the configuration of the group.

===== view-members
Policies covering if an admin can view the user details of members of the group.

===== manage-members
Policies covering if an admin can manage the users that belong to this group.

===== manage-membership
Policies covering if an admin can:

* Change the membership of the group.
* Add members from the group.
* Remove members from the group.
