= Creating an OTP

If OTP is conditional in your realm, the user must navigate to {project_name} Account Console to reconfigure a new OTP generator. If OTP is required, then the user must reconfigure a new OTP generator when logging in. 

Alternatively, you can send an email to the user that requests the user reset the OTP generator. The following procedure also applies if the user already has an OTP credential.

. Select a user.
. Click the *Credentials* tab.
. Navigate to the *Reset Actions* list.
. Click *Configure OTP*.
