== Creating a user

Administrators can create users and applications that are owned by the users of a specified realm. In the console, you can add users and register applications to be secured by {project_name}. 

A user can use the console to access applications in a realm, update profile information, and change credentials. 

Create users in the same realm that contains the applications for the user. Every user in a realm has access to the console and the applications in that realm.
