= Allowing users to self-register

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {project_name} as a third-party authorization server to manage application users, including users who self-register. If you enable self-registration, the login page displays a registration link so that user can create an account.

.Registration link

A user must add profile information to the registration form to complete registration. The registration form can be customized by removing or adding the fields that must be completed by a user.

.Clarification on identity brokering and admin API
Even when self-registrations is disabled, new users can be still added to {project_name} by either:

* Administrator can add new users with the usage of admin console (or admin REST API)
* When identity brokering is enabled, new users authenticated by identity provider may be automatically added/registered in {project_name} storage.
See the <<_identity_broker_first_login, First login flow section in the Identity Brokering chapter>> for more information.

Also users coming from the <<_user-storage-federation, 3rd-party user storage>> (for example LDAP) are automatically available in {project_name} when the particular user storage is enabled
