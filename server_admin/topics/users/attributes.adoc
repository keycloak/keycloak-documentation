=== User Attributes

Beyond basic user metadata like name and email, you can store arbitrary user attributes.  Choose a user to manage
then click on the `Attributes` tab.

.Users

Enter in the attribute name and value in the empty fields and click the `Add` button next to it to add a new field.
Note that any edits you make on this page will not be stored until you hit the `Save` button.

NOTE: Some attributes that are read-only and are not supposed to be updated by the administrators. This includes attributes, which are read-only
by design like for example `LDAP_ID`, which is filled automatically by the LDAP provider. Some other attributes should be read-only for
typical user administrators due to security reasons. See the details in the link:#_read_only_user_attributes[Threat model mitigation chapter].
