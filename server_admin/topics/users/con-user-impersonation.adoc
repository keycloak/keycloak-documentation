[id="con-user-impersonation_{context}"]
= User Impersonation

An administrator with the appropriate permissions can impersonate a user. For example, if a user experiences a bug in an application, an administrator can impersonate the user to investigate or duplicate the issue. 

Any user with the `impersonation` role in the realm can impersonate a user.

* If the administrator and the user are in the same realm, then the administrator will be logged out and automatically logged in as the user being impersonated.  
* If the administrator and user are not in the same realm, the administrator will remain logged in, and additionally will be logged in as the user in that user's realm.  

In both instances, the browser redirects to the impersonated user's *User Account Management* page. 

You can access the *Impersonate* button from the *Details* tab on the *Users* page.
