= Configuring user attributes

User attributes provide a customized experience for each user. You can create a personalized identity for each user in the console by configuring user attributes.

.Users

.Prerequisite
* You are in the realm where the user exists.

.Procedure
. Click *Users* in the menu.
. Select a user to manage.
. Click the *Attributes* tab.
. Enter the attribute name in the *Key* field.
. Enter the attribute value in the *Value* field.
. Click *Save*.


NOTE: Some read-only attributes are not supposed to be updated by the administrators. This includes attributes that are read-only
by design like for example `LDAP_ID`, which is filled automatically by the LDAP provider. Some other attributes should be read-only for
typical user administrators due to security reasons. See the details in the xref:_read_only_user_attributes[Mitigating security threats] chapter.
