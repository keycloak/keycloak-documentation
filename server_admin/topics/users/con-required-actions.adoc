== Required Actions

A user must complete required actions before initially logging in. A user must provide credentials before required actions can be executed. Once a required action is completed, the user does not have to perform the action again.

Admins can add required actions for each user, in the *Details* tab of the admin console.

The following are examples of required action types:

Update Password:: 
   The user must change their password.

Configure OTP::
   The user must configure a one-time password generator on their mobile device using either the Free OTP or Google Authenticator application.

Verify Email::
   The user must verify their email account.  An email will be sent to the user with a validation link that they must click.  Once this workflow is successfully completed, the user will be allowed to log in.

Update Profile::
   The user must update profile information, such as name, address, email, and phone number.
