=== User Registration

You can enable {project_name} to allow user self registration.  When enabled, the login page has a registration
link the user can click on to create their new account.

When user self registration is enabled it is possible to use the registration form to detect valid usernames and emails.
It is also possible to enable <<_recaptcha,reCAPTCHA Support>>.

Enabling registration is pretty simple.  Go to the
`Realm Settings` left menu and click it.  Then go to the `Login` tab.  There is a `User Registration` switch on this
tab.  Turn it on, then click the `Save` button.

and a new password.
