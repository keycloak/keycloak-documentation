= Defining user credentials

You can manage credentials of a user in the *Credentials* tab.

You change the priority of credentials by dragging and dropping rows. The new order determines the priority of the credentials for that user. The topmost credential has the highest priority. The priority determines which credential is displayed first after a user logs in.

Type::
   This column displays the type of credential, for example *password* or *OTP*.

User Label::
   This is an assignable label to recognize the credential when presented as a selection option during login. It can be set to any value to describe the
   credential.
   
Data::
   This is the non-confidential technical information about the credential. It is hidden, by default. You can click *Show data...* to display the data for a	
   credential.

Actions::
   Click *Reset password* to change the password for the user and *Delete* to remove the credential.

You cannot configure other types of credentials for a specific user in the Admin Console; that task is the user's responsibility.

You can delete the credentials of a user in the event a user loses an OTP device or if credentials have been compromised. You can only delete credentials of a user in the *Credentials* tab.
