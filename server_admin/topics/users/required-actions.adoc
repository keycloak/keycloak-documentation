=== Required Actions

Required Actions are tasks that a user must finish before they are allowed to log in.  A user must provide their credentials before required actions are executed.  Once a required action is completed, the user will not have
to perform the action again.
Here are explanations of some of the built-in required action types:

Update Password::
   When set, a user must change their password.
Configure OTP::
   When set, a user must configure a one-time password generator on their mobile device using either the Free OTP or Google Authenticator application.
Verify Email::
   When set, a user must verify that they have a valid email account.  An email will be sent to the user with a link they have to click.  Once this workflow
   is successfully completed, they will be allowed to log in.
Update Profile::
   This required action asks the user to update their profile information, i.e. their name, address, email, and/or phone number.

Admins can add required actions for each individual user within the user's `Details` tab in the Admin Console.

In the `Required User Actions` list box, select all the actions you want to add to the account.  If you want to remove one, click the `X` next to the
action name.  Also remember to click the `Save` button after you've decided what actions to add.

==== Default Required Actions

You can also specify required actions that will be added to an account whenever a new user is created, i.e. through the `Add User` button the user
list screen, or via the <<_user-registration, user registration>> link on the login page.  To specify
the default required actions go to the `Authentication` left menu item and click on the `Required Actions` tab.

Simply click the checkbox in the `Default Action` column of the required actions that you want to be executed when a brand new user logs in.

==== Terms and Conditions

Many organizations have a requirement that when a new user logs in for the first time, they need to agree to the terms and conditions
of the website.  {project_name} has this functionality implemented as a required action, but it requires some configuration.  For one, you
have to go to the `Required Actions` tab described earlier and enable the `Terms and Conditions` action.  You must also edit the
_terms.ftl_ file in the _base_ login theme.  See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information on extending and
creating themes.
