[role="_abstract"]

{project_name} includes control of the session, cookie, and token timeouts through the *Tokens* tab in the *Realm Settings* menu.

|Configuration|Description

|Default Signature Algorithm
|The default algorithm used to assign tokens for the realm.

[[_revoke-refresh-token]]
|Revoke Refresh Token
|When *ON*, {project_name} revokes refresh tokens and issues another token that the client must use. This action applies to OIDC clients performing the refresh token flow.

|SSO Session Idle
|This setting is for OIDC clients only. If a user is inactive for longer than this timeout, the user session is invalidated. This timeout value resets when clients request authentication or send a refresh token request. {project_name} adds a window of time to the idle timeout before the session invalidation takes effect. See the <<_idle_timeouts_note, note>> later in this section.

|SSO Session Max
|The maximum time before a user session expires.

|SSO Session Idle Remember Me
|This setting is similar to the standard SSO Session Idle configuration but specific to logins with `Remember Me` enabled. Users can specify longer session idle timeouts when they click `Remember Me` when logging in. This setting is an optional configuration and, if its value is not greater than zero, it uses the same idle timeout as the SSO Session Idle configuration.

|SSO Session Max Remember Me
|This setting is similar to the standard SSO Session Max but specific to `Remember Me` logins. Users can specify longer sessions when they click `Remember Me` when logging in. This setting is an optional configuration and, if its value is not greater than zero, it uses the same session lifespan as the SSO Session Max configuration.

[[_offline-session-idle]]
|Offline Session Idle
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>. The amount of time the session remains idle before {project_name} revokes its offline token. {project_name} adds a window of time to the idle timeout before the session invalidation takes effect. See the <<_idle_timeouts_note, note>> later in this section.

[[_offline-session-max-limited]]
|Offline Session Max Limited
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>. If this flag is *ON*, Offline Session Max can control the maximum time the offline token remains active, regardless of user activity. Client Offline Session Idle and Client Offline Session Max are enabled.

[[_offline-session-max]]
|Offline Session Max
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>, and it is the maximum time before {project_name} revokes the corresponding offline token. This option controls the maximum amount of time the offline token remains active, regardless of user activity.

|Client Offline Session Idle
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>. If a user is inactive for longer than this timeout, offline token requests bump the idle timeout. This setting specifies a shorter idle timeout of an offline token than the offline session idle. Users can override this setting for individual clients. This setting is an optional configuration and, when set to zero, uses the same idle timeout in the Offline Session Idle configuration.

|Client Offline Session Max
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>. The maximum time before an offline token expires and invalidates. This setting specifies a shorter token timeout than an offline session timeout, but users can override it for individual clients. This setting is an optional configuration and, when set to zero, uses the same idle timeout in the Offline Session Max configuration.

|Client Session Idle
|If the user is inactive for longer than this timeout, refresh token requests bump the idle timeout. This setting specifies a shorter idle timeout of refresh tokens than the session idle timeout, but users can override it for individual clients. This setting is an optional configuration and, when set to zero, uses the same idle timeout in the SSO Session Idle configuration.

|Client Session Max
|The maximum time before a refresh token expires and invalidates. This setting specifies a shorter timeout of refresh tokens than the session timeout, but users can override it for individual clients. This setting is an optional configuration and, when set to zero, uses the same idle timeout in the SSO Session Max configuration.

|Access Token Lifespan
|When {project_name} creates an OIDC access token, this value controls the lifetime of the token.

|Access Token Lifespan For Implicit Flow
|With the Implicit Flow, {project_name} does not provide a refresh token. A separate timeout exists for access tokens created by the Implicit Flow.

|Client login timeout
|The maximum time before clients must finish the Authorization Code Flow in OIDC.

|Login timeout
|The total time a logging in must take. If authentication takes longer than this time, the user must start the authentication process again.

|Login action timeout
|The Maximum time users can spend on any one page during the authentication process.

|User-Initiated Action Lifespan
|The maximum time before a user's action permission expires. Keep this value short because users generally react to self-created actions quickly.

|Default Admin-Initiated Action Lifespan
|The maximum time before an action permission sent to a user by an administrator expires. Keep this value long to allow administrators to send e-mails to offline users. An administrator can override the default timeout before issuing the token.

|Override User-Initiated Action Lifespan
|Specifies independent timeouts per individual operation (for example, e-mail verification, forgot password, user actions, and Identity Provider E-mail Verification). This value defaults to the value configured at _User-Initiated Action Lifespan_.

[[_idle_timeouts_note]]

[NOTE]
====
For idle timeouts, a two-minute window of time exists that the session is active. For example, when you have the timeout set to 30 minutes, it will be 32 minutes before the session expires. 

This action is necessary for some scenarios in cluster and cross-data center environments where the token refreshes on one cluster node a short time before the expiration and the other cluster nodes incorrectly consider the session as expired because they have not yet received the message about a successful refresh from the refreshing node.
