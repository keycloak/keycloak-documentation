=== Administering Sessions

To see a top-level view of the active clients and sessions in {project_name}, click *Sessions* from the menu.

==== The *Logout all* Operation

You can log out all users in the realm by clicking the *Logout all* button.

When you click the *Logout all* button, all SSO cookies become invalid, and clients requesting authentication within active browser sessions must log in again. {project_name} notifies clients by using the {project_name} OIDC client adapter of the logout event. Client types such as SAML do not receive a back-channel logout request.

[NOTE]
====
Clicking *Logout all* does not revoke outstanding access tokens. Outstanding tokens must expire naturally. For clients using the {project_name} OIDC client adapter, you can push a <<_revocation-policy, revocation policy>> to revoke the token, but this does not work for other adapters.

==== Application Navigation

On the `Sessions` page, you can click on each client to go to that client's `Sessions` tab. Click the *Show Sessions* button there to see which users are in the application.
