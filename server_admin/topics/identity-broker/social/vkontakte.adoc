==== VK.com

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to login to VK.com.  First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item
and select `VKontakte` from the `Add provider` drop-down list.  This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

.Add Identity Provider

You can't click save yet, as you'll need to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from VK.com.  One piece of data you'll need from this
page is the `Redirect URI`.  You'll have to provide that to VK.com when you register {project_name} as a client there, so
copy this URI to your clipboard.

To enable login with VK.com, you first have to register an application project in
`\https://vk.com/apps?act=manage`.

.Add a new App

Now enter an application title, select `Website` as the platform and add your domain and base-URL. 
Next click `Connect Site` to proceed. Your application will get created, and you have to go to the `Settings` menu on the left-hand side.

.Do the following changes

- Copy `Application ID` (`Client ID`) and `Secure key` (`Client Secret`) so you can paste them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.
- Enable `Open API` by clicking on the `Disabled` link beside it and select `Enabled`.
- Copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page and enter it into the `Authorized redirect URI` field.
- Confirm your settings by pressing the `Save` button
- Add at least `email` as `Default Scopes` in the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page. If you want to use the VK API for other requests
  You can request additional scopes. Please check the official documentation at https://vk.com/dev/permissions[Application Access Permissions]
