. Enter the required scopes into the *Default Scopes* field. By default, {project_name} uses the `email` scope. See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api[Graph API] for more information about Facebook scopes. 

{project_name} sends profile requests to `graph.facebook.com/me?fields=id,name,email,first_name,last_name` by default. The response contains the id, name, email, first_name, and last_name fields only. To fetch additional fields from the Facebook profile, add a corresponding scope and add the field name in the `Additional user's profile fields` configuration option field.
