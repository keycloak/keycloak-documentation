==== GitLab

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to enable login with GitLab.

First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item and select `GitLab` from the `Add provider` drop down list. This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

Before you can click `Save`, you must obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from GitLab.

NOTE: You will the use `Redirect URI` from this page in a later step, which you will provide to GitLab when you register {project_name} as a client there.

To enable login with GitLab you first have to register an application in
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html[GitLab as OAuth2 authentication service provider].

NOTE: GitLab often changes the look and feel of application registration, so what you see on the GitLab site may differ. If in doubt, see the GitLab documentation.

Copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page and enter it into the Redirect URI field on the GitLab Add new application page.

When you are done registering, click `Save application`. This will open the application management page in GitLab. Find the client ID and secret from this page so you can enter them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.

To finish, return to {project_name} and enter them. Click `Save`.
