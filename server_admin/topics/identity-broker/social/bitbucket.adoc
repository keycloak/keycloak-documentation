==== Bitbucket
There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to enable login with Bitbucket.

First, open the `Identity Providers` left menu item and select `Bitbucket` from the `Add provider` drop down list. This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

Before you can click `Save`, you must obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from Bitbucket.

NOTE: You will use the `Redirect URI` from this page in a later step, which you will provide to Bitbucket when you register {project_name} as a client there.

.Add a New App
To enable login with Bitbucket you must first register an application project in
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html[OAuth on Bitbucket Cloud].

NOTE: Bitbucket often changes the look and feel of application registration, so what you see on the Bitbucket site may differ. If in doubt, see the Bitbucket documentation.

Click the `Add consumer` button.

.Register App

Copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page and enter it into the Callback URL field on the Bitbucket Add OAuth Consumer page.

On the same page, mark the `Email` and `Read` boxes under `Account` to allow your application to read user email.

When you are done registering, click `Save`. This will open the application management page in Bitbucket. Find the client ID and secret from this page so you can enter them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page. Click `Save`.
