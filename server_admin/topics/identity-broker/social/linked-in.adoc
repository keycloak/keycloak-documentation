==== LinkedIn

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to login to LinkedIn.  First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item
and select `LinkedIn` from the `Add provider` drop down list.  This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

You can't click save yet, as you'll need to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from LinkedIn.  One piece of data you'll need from this
page is the `Redirect URI`.  You'll have to provide that to LinkedIn when you register {project_name} as a client there, so
copy this URI to your clipboard.

To enable login with LinkedIn you first have to create an application in https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps[LinkedIn Developer Network].

NOTE: LinkedIn may change the look and feel of application registration, so these directions may not always be up to date.

Click on the `Create Application` button.  This will bring you to the `Create a New Application` Page.

Fill in the form with the appropriate values, then click the `Submit` button.  This will bring you to the new application's settings page.

Select `r_basicprofile` and `r_emailaddress` in the `Default Application Permissions` section.
You'll have to copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page and enter it into the
`OAuth 2.0` `Authorized Redirect URLs` field on the LinkedIn app settings page.  Don't forget to click the `Update` button after
you do this!

You will then need to obtain the client ID and secret from this page so you can enter them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.
Go back to {project_name} and specify those items.
