=== Identity broker logout

When logging out, {project_name} sends a request to the external identity provider that is used to log in initially and logs the user out of this identity provider. You can skip this behavior and avoid logging out of the external identity provider. See link:{adapterguide_logout_link}[adapter logout documentation] for more information.
