=== Identity broker logout

When logout from {project_name} is triggered, {project_name} will send a request to the external identity provider
that was used to login to Keycloak, and the user will be logged out from this identity provider as well.
It is possible to skip this behaviour and avoid logout at the external identity provider.
See link:{adapterguide_logout_link}[adapter logout documentation] for more details.
