=== Client-suggested Identity Provider

OIDC applications can bypass the {project_name} login page by hinting at the identity provider they want to use. You can enable this by setting the `kc_idp_hint` query parameter in the Authorization Code Flow authorization endpoint.

With {project_name} OIDC client adapters, you can specify this query parameter when you access a secured resource in the application.

For example:

[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
GET /myapplication.com?kc_idp_hint=facebook HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
----

In this case, your realm must have an identity provider with a `facebook` alias. If this provider does not exist,  the login form is displayed.

If you are using the `keycloak.js` adapter, you can also achieve the same behavior as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
var keycloak = new Keycloak('keycloak.json');

keycloak.createLoginUrl({
	idpHint: 'facebook'
});
----

With the `kc_idp_hint` query parameter, the client can override the default identity provider if you configure one for the `Identity Provider Redirector` authenticator. The client can  disable the automatic redirecting by setting the `kc_idp_hint` query parameter to an empty value.
