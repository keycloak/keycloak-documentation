=== Default Identity Provider

{project_name} can redirect to an identity provider rather than displaying the login form. To enable this redirection:

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Browser* flow.
. Select *Identity Provider Redirector* from the drop-down list. 
. Set *Default Identity Provider* to the identity provider you want to redirect users to.

If {project_name} does not find the configured default identity provider, the login form is displayed.

This authenticator is responsible for processing the `kc_idp_hint` query parameter. See the <<_client_suggested_idp, client suggested identity provider>> section for more information.
