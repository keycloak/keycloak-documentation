== Managing user sessions

When users log into realms, {project_name} maintains a user session for each user and remembers each client visited by the user within the session. Realm administrators can perform multiple actions on each user session:

* View login statistics for the realm.
* View active users and where they logged in.
* Log a user out of their session.
* Revoke tokens.
* Set up token timeouts.
* Set up session timeouts.
