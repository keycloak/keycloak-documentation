In the preceding example, we are assigning the composite role *developer* to a user. That role was created in the <<_composite-roles, Composite Roles>> topic.

When the *developer* role is assigned, the *employee* role associated with the *developer* composite is displayed in the *Effective Roles* box. *Effective Roles* are the roles explicitly assigned to users and roles that are inherited from composites.
