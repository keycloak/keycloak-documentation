{project_name} is a single sign on solution for web apps and RESTful web services.  The goal of {project_name}
is to make security simple so that it is easy for application developers to secure the apps and services they have deployed
in their organization.  Security features that developers normally have to write for themselves are provided out of the box
and are easily tailorable to the individual requirements of your organization.  {project_name} provides customizable
user interfaces for login, registration, administration, and account management.  You can also use {project_name} as an
integration platform to hook it into existing LDAP and Active Directory servers.  You can also delegate authentication to third
party identity providers like Facebook and Google.
