[[_vault-administration]]

== Using a Vault to Obtain Secrets

Several fields in the administration support obtaining the value of a secret from an external vault.

To obtain a secret from a vault instead of entering it directly, enter
the following specially crafted string into the appropriate field:
`**${vault.**_key_**}**` where you replace the `_key_`
with the name of the secret as recognized by the vault.

In order to prevent secrets from leaking across realms, implementations may combine the realm name with the `_key_`
obtained from the vault expression. This means that the `_key_` won't directly map to an entry in the vault, but rather
be used to create the final entry name according to the algorithm used to combine it with the realm name.

Currently, the secret can be obtained from the vault in the following fields:

SMTP password::
  In realm <<_email,SMTP settings>>

LDAP bind credential::
  In <<_ldap,LDAP settings>> of LDAP-based user federation.

OIDC identity provider secret::
  In _Client Secret_ inside identity provider <<_identity_broker_oidc,OpenID Connect Config>>

To use a vault, a vault provider must be registered within {project_name}.
It is possible to either use a built-in provider described below or
implement your own provider. See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

NOTE: There is at most one vault provider active per {project_name} instance
at any given time, and the vault provider in each instance within the cluster
has to be configured consistently.

=== Kubernetes / OpenShift Files Plaintext Vault Provider

{project_name} supports vault implementation for https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes secrets]. These secrets
can be mounted as data volumes, and they appear as a directory with a flat file structure, where each secret is represented by a file whose name is the secret name, and contents of that file is the secret value.

The files within this directory have to be named as secret name prefixed by realm name and an underscore. All underscores within the secret name or the realm name have to be doubled in the file name. For example, for a field within a realm called `sso_realm`, a reference to a secret with name `secret-name` would be written as `${vault.secret-name}`, and the file name looked up would be `sso+++__+++realm+++_+++secret-name` (note the underscore doubled in realm name).

To use this type of secret store, you have to declare the `files-plaintext` vault provider in standalone.xml, and set its parameter for the directory that contains the mounted volume. The following example shows the `files-plaintext`
provider with the directory where vault files are searched for set to `standalone/configuration/vault` relative to {project_name} base directory:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="vault">
    <default-provider>files-plaintext</default-provider>
    <provider name="files-plaintext" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="dir" value="${jboss.home.dir}/standalone/configuration/vault/" />
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

Here is the equivalent configuration using CLI commands:

[source,bash]
----
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault/:add
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault/provider=files-plaintext/:add(enabled=true,properties={dir => "${jboss.home.dir}/standalone/configuration/vault"})
----

=== Elytron Credential Store Vault Provider

{project_name} also provides support for reading secrets stored in an Elytron credential store. The `elytron-cs-keystore`
vault provider is capable of retrieving secrets from the keystore-based implementation of the credential store, which
is also the default implementation provided by Elytron.

This credential store is backed by a keystore (`JCEKS` is the default format, but it is possible to use other formats such as `PKCS12`)
and users can create and manage the store contents using either the `elytron` subsystem in WildFly/JBoss EAP, or using the
`elytron-tool.sh` script.

To use this provider, you have to declare the `elytron-cs-keystore` in the `keycloak-server` subsystem and set the location
and master secret of the keystore that was created by Elytron. An example of the minimal configuration for the provider follows:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="vault">
    <default-provider>elytron-cs-keystore</default-provider>
    <provider name="elytron-cs-keystore" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="location" value="${jboss.home.dir}/standalone/configuration/vault/credential-store.jceks" />
            <property name="secret" value="secretpw1!"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

If the underlying keystore has a format other than `JCEKS`, this format has to be informed using the `keyStoreType`:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="vault">
    <default-provider>elytron-cs-keystore</default-provider>
    <provider name="elytron-cs-keystore" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="location" value="${jboss.home.dir}/standalone/configuration/vault/credential-store.p12" />
            <property name="secret" value="secretpw1!"/>
            <property name="keyStoreType" value="PKCS12"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

For the secret, the `elytron-cs-keystore` provider supports both clear-text values (as shown above) and also values that
were masked using the `elytron-tool.sh` script:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="vault">
   ...
            <property name="secret" value="MASK-3u2HNQaMogJJ8VP7J6gRIl;12345678;321"/>
   ...
</spi>
----

For more detailed information on how to create/manage elytron credential stores, as well as how to mask keystore secrets,
please refer to the Elytron documentation.

NOTE: The `elytron-cs-keystore` vault provider has been implemented as a WildFly extension and as such is only available
if the {project_name} server runs on WildFly/JBoss EAP.

=== Key Resolvers

All built-in providers support the configuration of one or more key resolvers. A key resolver essentially implements
the algorithm or strategy for combining the realm name with the key (as obtained from the `${vault.key}` expression) into
the final entry name that will be used to retrieve the secret from the vault. The `keyResolvers` property is used to configure
the resolvers that are to be used by the provider. The value is a comma-separated list of resolver names. An example of
configuration for the `files-plaintext` provider follows:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="vault">
    <default-provider>files-plaintext</default-provider>
    <provider name="files-plaintext" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="dir" value="${jboss.home.dir}/standalone/configuration/vault/" />
            <property name="keyResolvers" value="REALM_UNDERSCORE_KEY, KEY_ONLY"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

The resolvers are executed in the same order that they are declared in the configuration. For each resolver, the final entry
name produced by the resolver that combines the realm with the vault key is used to search for the secret in the vault.
If a secret is found, it is immediately returned. If not, the next resolver is used and this continues until a non-empty
secret is found or all resolvers have been tried, in which case an empty secret is returned. In the example above, first
the `REALM_UNDERSCORE_KEY` resolver is used. If an entry is found in the vault with the name it produces, it is returned.
If not, then the `KEY_ONLY` resolver is used. Again, if an entry is found in the vault with the name it produces, it is
returned. If not, an empty secret is returned since there are no more resolvers to be used.

A list of the currently available resolvers follows:

* `KEY_ONLY`: the realm name is ignored and the key from the vault expression is used as is.
* `REALM_UNDERSCORE_KEY`: the realm and key are combined using an underscore `_` character. Occurrences of underscore in either the
realm or key are escaped by another underscore character. So if the realm is called `master_realm` and the key is `smtp_key`, the
combined key will be `master+++__+++realm_smtp+++__+++key`.
* `REALM_FILESEPARATOR_KEY`: the realm and key are combined using the platform file separator character. This is useful in situations
where the keys are grouped by realm using a directory structure.
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
* `FACTORY_PROVIDED`: the realm and key are combined using the `VaultKeyResolver` that is provided by the vault provider factory,
allowing the creation of a custom key resolver by extending an existing factory and implementing the `getFactoryResolver` method.
endif::[]

If no resolver is configured for the built-in providers, the `REALM_UNDERSCORE_KEY` is selected by default.

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
The `FACTORY_PROVIDED` resolver provides a hook that can be used to implement a custom resolver by extending the provider
factory of choice and overriding the `getFactoryResolver` method so it returns the custom resolver. For example, if you want
to use the `elytron-cs-keystore` provider but none of the built-in resolvers match the format used in your keystore, you
can extend the `ElytronCSKeystoreProvider` and implement the `getFactoryResolver` method:

[source,java]
----
    public class CustomElytronProviderFactory extends ElytronCSKeyStoreProviderFactory {
        ...
        @Override
        protected VaultKeyResolver getFactoryResolver() {
            return (realm, key) -> realm + "###" + key;
        }

        @Override
        public String getId() {
            return "custom-elytron-cs-keystore;
        }

        ...
    }
----

The custom factory returns a key resolver that combines the realm and key with a triple `#` character. So an entry would look
like `master_realm###smtp_key`, for example. This factory must then be installed just like any custom provider.

Note that the custom factory must override both the `getFactoryResolver` and `getId` methods. The second method is needed so that
we can properly configure the custom factory in {project_name}.

To install and use the above custom provider the configuration would look something like this:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="vault">
    <default-provider>custom-elytron-cs-keystore</default-provider>
    <provider name="custom-elytron-cs-keystore" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="location" value="${jboss.home.dir}/standalone/configuration/vault/credential-store.p12" />
            <property name="secret" value="MASK-3u2HNQaMogJJ8VP7J6gRIl;12345678;321"/>
            <property name="keyStoreType" value="PKCS12"/>
            <property name="keyResolvers" value="FACTORY_PROVIDED"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

The configuration above tells {project_name} to setup the custom Elytron provider and use the key resolver that is created by
the custom factory.
endif::[]

=== Sample Configuration

The following is an example of configuring a vault and credential store.  The procedure involves two parts:

* Creating the credential store and a vault, where the credential store and vault passwords are in plain text.
* Updating the credential store and vault to have the password use a mask provided by `elytron-tool.sh`.

In this example, the test target used is an LDAP instance with `BIND DN credential: secret12`. The target is mapped using user federation in the realm `ldaptest`.

==== Configuring the credential store and vault without a mask

You create the credential store and a vault where the credential store and vault passwords are in plain text.

.Prerequisites

* A running LDAP instance has `BIND DN credential: secret12`.  

* The alias uses the format <realm-name>_< key-value> when using the default key resolver. In this case, the instance is running in the realm `ldaptest` and `ldaptest_ldap_secret` is the alias that corresponds to the value `ldap_secret` in that realm.

NOTE: The resolver replaces underscore characters with double underscore characters in the realm and key names. For example, for the key `ldaptest_ldap_secret`, the final key will be `ldaptest_ldap__secret`.

.Procedure

. Create the Elytron credential store.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron/credential-store=test-store:add(create=true, location=/home/test/test-store.p12, credential-reference={clear-text=testpwd1!},implementation-properties={keyStoreType=PKCS12})
----

. Add an alias to the credential store. 

+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=test-store:add-alias(alias=ldaptest_ldap__secret,secret-value=secret12)
----
+
Notice how the resolver causes the key `ldaptest_ldap__secret` to use double underscores.

. List the aliases from the credential store to inspect the contents of the keystore that is produced by Elytron.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
keytool -list -keystore /home/test/test-store.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -storepass testpwd1!
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entries

ldaptest_ldap__secret/passwordcredential/clear/, Oct 12, 2020, SecretKeyEntry, 
----

. Configure the vault SPI in {project_name}.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault:add(default-provider=elytron-cs-keystore)

/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault/provider=elytron-cs-keystore:add(enabled=true, properties={location=>/home/test/test-store.p12, secret=>testpwd1!, keyStoreType=>PKCS12})
----
+
At this point, the vault and credentials store passwords are not masked.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
        <spi name="vault">
                <default-provider>elytron-cs-keystore</default-provider>
                <provider name="elytron-cs-keystore" enabled="true">
                    <properties>
                        <property name="location" value="/home/test/test-store.p12"/>
                        <property name="secret" value="testpwd1!"/>
                        <property name="keyStoreType" value="PKCS12"/>
                    </properties>
                </provider>
            </spi>

         <credential-stores>
                <credential-store name="test-store" location="/home/test/test-store.p12" create="true">
                    <implementation-properties>
                        <property name="keyStoreType" value="PKCS12"/>
                    </implementation-properties>
                    <credential-reference clear-text="testpwd1!"/>
                </credential-store>
         </credential-stores>
----

. In the LDAP provider, replace `binDN credential` with `${vault.ldap_secret}`.

. Test your LDAP connection.

==== Masking the password in the credential store and vault

You can now update the credential store and vault to have passwords that use a mask provided by `elytron-tool.sh`.

. Create a masked password using values for the `salt` and the `iteration` parameters:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ EAP_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh mask --salt SALT --iteration ITERATION_COUNT --secret PASSWORD
----
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
elytron-tool.sh mask --salt 12345678 --iteration 123 --secret testpwd1!
MASK-3BUbFEyWu0lRAu8.fCqyUk;12345678;123
----

. Update the Elytron credential store configuration to use the masked password.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=cs-store:write-attribute(name=credential-reference.clear-text,value="MASK-3BUbFEyWu0lRAu8.fCqyUk;12345678;123")
----

. Update the {project_name} vault configuration to use the masked password. 
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault/provider=elytron-cs-keystore:remove()
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault/provider=elytron-cs-keystore:add(enabled=true, properties={location=>/home/test/test-store.p12, secret=>”MASK-3BUbFEyWu0lRAu8.fCqyUk;12345678;123”, keyStoreType=>PKCS12})
----
+
The vault and credential store are now masked:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
        <spi name="vault">
                <default-provider>elytron-cs-keystore</default-provider>
                <provider name="elytron-cs-keystore" enabled="true">
                    <properties>
                        <property name="location" value="/home/test/test-store.p12"/>
                        <property name="secret" value="MASK-3BUbFEyWu0lRAu8.fCqyUk;12345678;123"/>
                        <property name="keyStoreType" value="PKCS12"/>
                    </properties>
                </provider>
            </spi>
         ....
         .....
         <credential-stores>
                <credential-store name="test-store" location="/home/test/test-store.p12" create="true">
                    <implementation-properties>
                        <property name="keyStoreType" value="PKCS12"/>
                    </implementation-properties>
                    <credential-reference clear-text="MASK-3BUbFEyWu0lRAu8.fCqyUk;12345678;123"/>
                </credential-store>
         </credential-stores>
----

. You can now test the connection to the LDAP using `${vault.ldap_secret}`.
