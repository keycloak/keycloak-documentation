=== LDAP and Active Directory

{project_name} comes with a built-in LDAP/AD provider.  It is possible to federate multiple different LDAP servers in the same
{project_name} realm.  You can map LDAP user attributes into the {project_name} common user model.
By default, it maps username, email, first name, and last name, but you are free to configure additional <<_ldap_mappers,mappings>>.
The LDAP provider also supports password validation via LDAP/AD protocols and different storage, edit, and synchronization modes.

To configure a federated LDAP store go to the Admin Console.
Click on the `User Federation` left menu option.
When you get to this page there is an `Add Provider` select box.
You should see _ldap_ within this list.
Selecting _ldap_ will bring you to the LDAP configuration page.

==== Storage Mode

By default, {project_name} will import users from LDAP into the local {project_name} user database. This copy of the user
is either synchronized on demand, or through a periodic background task.
The single exception to this is the synchronization of passwords. Passwords are never imported. Their validation is always delegated to the LDAP server.
The benefits of this approach is that all {project_name} features will work as any extra per-user data that is needed can be stored locally.
The downside of this approach is that each time that a specific user is queried for the first time, a corresponding {project_name} database insert is performed.
The import may also have to be synchronized with your LDAP server. However, import synchronization is not necessary in
the case that the LDAP mappers are configured to always read particular attributes from the LDAP rather than from the database.

Alternatively, you can choose not to import users into the {project_name} user database.  In this case, the common user model
that the  {project_name} runtime uses is backed only by the LDAP server.  This means that if LDAP doesn't support
a piece of data that a {project_name} feature needs that feature will not work.
The benefit to this approach is that you do not have the overhead of importing and synchronizing a copy of the LDAP user into the
{project_name} user database.

This storage mode is controled by the `Import Users` switch.  Set to `On` to import users.

NOTE: If user import is disabled, you cannot save user profile attributes into the {project_name} database. Also you cannot save
      metadata except for user profile metadata that are mapped to the LDAP. The single exception to this are user profile metadata,
      which are mapped to the LDAP. This possibly includes role mappings, group mappings and other metadata based on the configuration
      of your LDAP mappers.
      When the attempt is made to change some of the non-LDAP mapped user data, the update of the user will not be possible. For example
      you will not be able to disable the LDAP mapped user unless the `enabled` flag of the user is mapped to some LDAP
      attribute (which is usually not the case).

==== Edit Mode

Users, through the <<_account-service, User Account Service>>, and admins through the Admin Console
have the ability to modify user metadata.  Depending on your setup you may or may not have LDAP update privileges.  The
`Edit Mode` configuration option defines the edit policy you have with your LDAP store.

READONLY::
  Username, email, first name, last name, and other mapped attributes will be unchangeable.
  {project_name} will show an error anytime anybody tries to update these fields.
  Also, password updates will not be supported.

WRITABLE::
  Username, email, first name, last name, and other mapped attributes and passwords can all be updated and will be synchronized automatically with your LDAP store.

UNSYNCED::
  Any changes to username, email, first name, last name, and passwords will be stored in {project_name} local storage.
  It is up to you to figure out how to synchronize back to LDAP. This allows {project_name} deployments to support
  updates of user metadata on a read-only LDAP server.  This option only applies when you are importing users from LDAP into the local {project_name} user database.

NOTE: When the LDAP provider is created, the set of initial <<_ldap_mappers,LDAP mappers>> is created. The mappers are configured on a "best-effort" basis
      based on the chosen combination of the `Vendor`, `Edit Mode`, and `Import Users` switches. For example in case of UNSYNCED edit mode, the mappers are pre-configured
      in a way that a particular user attribute is preferably read from the database instead of from the LDAP. However when you later change the edit mode,
      the mappers configuration will not be changed as it is not easily possible to detect if they were manually changed in the meantime.
      This means that it is recommended NOT to update the `Edit Mode` switch, but rather always decide on `Edit Mode` when creating the
      LDAP provider. This applies for `Import Users` switch as well.

==== Other config options

Console Display Name::
  Name used when this provider is referenced in the admin console

Priority::
  The priority of this provider when looking up users or adding a user.

Sync Registrations::
  Does your LDAP support adding new users?  Click this switch if you want new users created by {project_name} in the admin console or the registration page
  to be added to LDAP.

Allow Kerberos authentication::
  Enable Kerberos/SPNEGO authentication in realm with users data provisioned from LDAP.
  More info in <<_kerberos,Kerberos section>>.

Other options::
  The rest of the configuration options should be self explanatory.
  You can hover the mouse pointer over the tooltips in the Admin Console to see some more details about them.

==== Connect to LDAP over SSL

When you configure a secured connection URL to your LDAP store (for example,`ldaps://myhost.com:636'), {project_name} will use SSL for communication with the LDAP server.
The important thing is to properly configure a truststore on the {project_name} server side, otherwise {project_name} can't trust the SSL connection to LDAP.

The global truststore for the {project_name} can be configured with the Truststore SPI.  Please check out the link:{installguide_link}[{installguide_name}] for more details.
If you do not figure the truststore SPI, the truststore will fall back on the default mechanism provided by Java (either the file provided by system property `javax.net.ssl.trustStore`
or the cacerts file from the JDK if the system property is not set).

There is a configuration property `Use Truststore SPI` in the LDAP federation provider configuration, where you can choose whether the Truststore SPI is used.
By default, the value is `Only for ldaps`, which is fine for most deployments.  The Truststore SPI will only be used
if the connection URL to LDAP starts with `ldaps`.

If the LDAP server is setup with Mutual TLS, the server will request a client certificate from Keycloak.

If using ldaps, specify the client certificate to respond to the client request, start keycloak with following:
[source]
----

bin/standalone.sh
-Dkeycloak.tls.keystore.path=KEYSTORE_PATH
-Dkeycloak.tls.keystore.password=KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
----
If using starttls, specify the client certificate to respond to the client request, start keycloak with the following:
[source]
----

bin/standalone.sh
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=KEYSTORE_PATH
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
----

==== Sync of LDAP users to {project_name}

If you enable the Import Users option, the LDAP Provider will automatically take care of synchronization (import) of needed LDAP users into the {project_name} local database.
As users log in, the LDAP provider will import the LDAP user
into the {project_name} database and then authenticate against the LDAP password. This is the only time users will be imported.
If you go to the `Users` left menu item in the Admin Console and click the `View all users` button, you will only see those LDAP users that
have been authenticated at least once by {project_name}.  It is implemented this way so that this operation does not trigger an import of the entire LDAP user database.

If you want to sync all LDAP users into the {project_name} database, you may configure and enable the `Sync Settings` on the LDAP provider configuration page. 
Two types of synchronization exist:

Periodic Full sync::
  This type will synchronize all LDAP users into the {project_name} database.
  Those LDAP users, which already exist in {project_name} and were changed in LDAP directly will be updated in the {project_name} database.  For example, the user `Mary Kelly` was changed in LDAP to `Mary Smith`.

Periodic Changed users sync::
  When syncing occurs, only those users that were created or updated after the last sync will be updated and/or imported.

The best way to handle syncing is to click the `Synchronize all users` button when you first create the LDAP provider,
then set up a periodic sync of changed users.

[[_ldap_mappers]]

==== LDAP Mappers

LDAP mappers are `listeners`, which are triggered by the LDAP Provider at various points and provide another extension point to LDAP integration.
They are triggered when a user logs in via LDAP and needs to be imported, during {project_name} initiated registration, or when a user is queried from the Admin Console.
When you create an LDAP Federation provider, {project_name} will automatically provide set of built-in `mappers` for this provider.
You are free to change this set and create a new mapper or update/delete existing ones.

User Attribute Mapper::
  This allows you to specify which LDAP attribute is mapped to which attribute of {project_name} user.
  So, for example, you can configure that LDAP attribute `mail` to the attribute `email` in the {project_name} database.
  For this mapper implementation, there is always a one-to-one mapping (one LDAP attribute is mapped to one {project_name} attribute)

FullName Mapper::
  This allows you to specify that the full name of the user, which is saved in some LDAP attribute (usually `cn` ) will be mapped to `firstName` and `lastname` attributes in the {project_name} database.
  Having `cn` to contain full name of user is a common case for some LDAP deployments.

NOTE: When registering new users in {project_name} and `Sync Registrations` is ON for the LDAP provider, the fullName mapper
      allows the possibility of fallback to the username. This fallback is especially useful in case of the Microsoft Active Directory. The common
      setup for the MSAD is to configure `cn` LDAP attribute as fullName and at the same time, the `cn` is usually used as `RDN LDAP Attribute`
      in the configuration of the LDAP provider. With this setup, the fallback to the username will be used. For example when you create
      {project_name} user "john123" and leave firstName and lastName empty, then fullname mapper will save "john123" as the value of the `cn` in LDAP.
      When you later enter "John Doe" for firstName and lastName, the fullname mapper will update LDAP `cn` to the value "John Doe" as
      fallback to the username will not be needed anymore.

Hardcoded Attribute Mapper::
  This mapper adds a hardcoded attribute value to each {project_name} user linked with LDAP. 
  This mapper can also force the values for the `enabled` or `emailVerified` user properties.

Role Mapper::
  This allows you to configure role mappings from LDAP into {project_name} role mappings.
  One Role mapper can be used to map LDAP roles (usually groups from a particular branch of LDAP tree) into roles corresponding to either realm roles or client roles of a specified client.
  It's not a problem to configure more Role mappers for the same LDAP provider.
  So for example you can specify that role mappings from groups under
  `ou=main,dc=example,dc=org` will be mapped to realm role mappings and role mappings from groups under
  `ou=finance,dc=example,dc=org` will be mapped to client role mappings of client `finance`.

Hardcoded Role Mapper::
  This mapper will grant a specified {project_name} role to each {project_name} user from the LDAP provider.

Group Mapper::
  This allows you to map LDAP groups from a particular branch of an LDAP tree into groups in {project_name}.
  It will also propagate user-group mappings from LDAP into user-group mappings in {project_name}.

MSAD User Account Mapper::
  This mapper is specific to Microsoft Active Directory (MSAD). It's able to tightly integrate the MSAD user account state
  into the {project_name} account state (account enabled, password is expired, and so on).
  It is using the `userAccountControl` and `pwdLastSet` LDAP attributes, which are both specific to MSAD and are not LDAP standard.
  For example if `pwdLastSet` is `0`, the {project_name} user is required to update their password
  and there will be an UPDATE_PASSWORD required action added to the user. If `userAccountControl` is
  `514` (disabled account) the {project_name} user is disabled as well.

Certificate Mapper::
  This mapper is specific for mapping X.509 certificates. It will generally be used in conjunction with X.509 authentication
  and `Full certificate in PEM format` as an identity source.
  It behaves the same way as the `User Attribute Mapper`, but allows {project_name} to filter for an LDAP attribute which stores
  a certificate in either PEM or DER format. It is generally advised to enable `Always Read Value From LDAP` with this mapper.

By default, there are User Attribute mappers that map basic {project_name} user attributes like username, firstname, lastname, and email to corresponding LDAP attributes.
You are free to extend these and provide additional attribute mappings.
Admin console provides tooltips, which should help with configuring the corresponding mappers.

[[_ldap_password_hashing]]
==== Password Hashing

When the password of user is updated from {project_name} and sent to LDAP, it is always sent in plain-text. This is different from
updating the password to built-in {project_name} database, when the hashing and salting is applied to the password before it is sent to DB.
In the case of LDAP, the {project_name} relies on the LDAP server to provide hashing and salting of passwords.

LDAP servers such as Microsoft Active Directory, RHDS or FreeIPA provide this by default. Others such as OpenLDAP or ApacheDS may store the passwords
in plain-text by default unless you use the _LDAPv3 Password Modify Extended Operation_ as per *RFC3062*. The LDAPv3 Password Modify Extended Operation
must be enabled explicitly in the LDAP configuration page. See the documentation of your LDAP server for more details.

WARNING: Always verify that user passwords are properly hashed and not stored as plaintext by inspecting a changed
directory entry using `ldapsearch` and base64 decode the `userPassword` attribute value.

[[_ldap_troubleshooting]]
==== Troubleshooting

- It is useful to increase the logging level to TRACE for the category `org.keycloak.storage.ldap`. You increase this level in the logging
subsystem in the `standalone(-ha).xml` file. With this setting, many logging messages are sent
to the `server.log` file in the `TRACE` level, including the logging for all queries to the LDAP server and the parameters, which were
used to send the queries. When you are creating any LDAP question on user forum or JIRA, consider attaching the server log with
enabled TRACE logging. If it is too big, the good alternative is to include just the snippet from server log with the messages, which were
added to the log during the operation, which causes the issues to you.


- When you create LDAP provider, message appear in the server log in the INFO level starting with:
```
Creating new LDAP Store for the LDAP storage provider: ...
```
It shows the configuration of your LDAP provider. Before you are asking the questions or reporting bugs, it will be nice to include this
message to show your LDAP configuration. Eventually feel free to replace some config changes, which you do not want to include, with some
placeholder values. One example is `bindDn=some-placeholder` . For `connectionUrl`, feel free to replace it as well, but it is generally
useful to include at least the protocol, which was used (`ldap` vs `ldaps`)`. Similarly it can be useful to include the details for
configuration of your LDAP mappers, which are displayed with the message like this at the DEBUG level:
```
Mapper for provider: XXX, Mapper name: YYY, Provider: ZZZ ...
```
Note those messages are displayed just with the enabled DEBUG logging.

- For tracking the performance or connection pooling issues, consider setting the value of property `Connection Pool Debug Level` of
the LDAP provider to value `all`. This will add lots of additional messages to server log with the included logging for the LDAP connection
pooling. This can be used to track the issues related to connection pooling or performance.

NOTE: After changing the configuration of connection pooling, you may need to restart the Keycloak server to enforce re-initialization
of the LDAP provider connection.

If no more messages appear for connection pooling even after server restart, it can indicate that connection pooling does not work
with your LDAP server.

- For the case of reporting LDAP issue, you may consider to attach some part of your LDAP tree with the target data, which causes issues
in your environment. For example if login of some user takes lot of time, you can consider attach his LDAP entry showing count of `member` attributes
of various "group" entries. In this case, it might be useful to add if those group entries are mapped to some Group LDAP mapper (or Role LDAP Mapper)
in {project_name} etc.
