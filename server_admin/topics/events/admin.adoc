=== Admin events

You can record all actions that are performed by an administrator in the Admin Console. The Admin Console performs administrative actions by invoking the {project_name} REST interface and {project_name} audits these REST invocations. You can view the resulting events in the Admin Console.

To enable auditing of Admin actions:

.Procedure
. Click *Events* in the menu.
. Click the *Config* tab.

.Event configuration

+
. Toggle *Save Events* to *ON* in the *Admin Events Settings* section. {project_name} displays the *Include Representation* switch.

+
. Toggle *Include Representation* to *ON*.

The `Include Representation` switch includes JSON documents sent through the admin REST API so you can view the administrators actions. To clear the database of stored actions, click *Clear admin events*.

To view the admin events, click the *Admin Events* tab.

If the `Details` column has a *Representation* button, click the *Representation* button to view the JSON {project_name} sent with the operation.
