=== Auditing user events

You can record and view every event that affects users. {project_name} triggers login events for actions such as successful user login, a user entering an incorrect password, or a user account updating. By default, {project_name} does not store or display events in the Admin Console. Only the error events are logged to the Admin Console and the serverâ€™s log file.

.Procedure

Use this procedure to start auditing user events.

. Click *Realm settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Events* tab.
. Click the *User events settings* tab.
. Toggle *Save events* to *ON*.

Each event has a corresponding error event.

==== Event listener

Event listeners listen for events and perform actions based on that event. {project_name} includes two built-in listeners, the Logging Event Listener and Email Event Listener.

===== The logging event listener
When the Logging Event Listener is enabled, this listener writes to a log file when an error event occurs.

An example log message from a Logging Event Listener:

----
11:36:09,965 WARN  [org.keycloak.events] (default task-51) type=LOGIN_ERROR, realmId=master,
                    clientId=myapp,
                    userId=19aeb848-96fc-44f6-b0a3-59a17570d374, ipAddress=127.0.0.1,
                    error=invalid_user_credentials, auth_method=openid-connect, auth_type=code,
                    redirect_uri=http://localhost:8180/myapp,
                    code_id=b669da14-cdbb-41d0-b055-0810a0334607, username=admin
----

You can use the Logging Event Listener to protect against hacker bot attacks:

. Parse the log file for the `LOGIN_ERROR` event.
. Extract the IP Address of the failed login event.
. Send the IP address to an intrusion prevention software framework tool.

The Logging Event Listener logs events to the `org.keycloak.events` log category. {project_name} does not include debug log events in server logs, by default.

To include debug log events in server logs:

. Change the log level for the `org.keycloak.events` category
. Change the log level used by the Logging Event listener.

To change the log level used by the Logging Event listener, add the following:

[source,bash]
----
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start --spi-events-listener-jboss-logging-success-level=info --spi-events-listener-jboss-logging-error-level=error
----

The valid values for log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

===== The Email Event Listener

The Email Event Listener sends an email to the user's account when an event occurs and supports the following events:

* Login Error.
* Update Password.
* Update Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).
* Remove Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).

.Procedure

To enable the Email Listener:

. Click *Realm settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Events* tab.
. Click the *Event listeners* field.
. Select `email`.

You can exclude events by using the `--spi-events-listener-email-exclude-events` argument. For example:

[source,bash]
----
kc.[sh|bat] --spi-events-listener-email-exclude-events=UPDATE_TOTP,REMOVE_TOTP
----

You can set a maximum length of each Event detail in the database by using the `--spi-events-store-jpa-max-detail-length` argument. This setting is useful if a detail (for example, redirect_uri) is long. For example:

[source,bash]
----
kc.[sh|bat] --spi-events-store-jpa-max-detail-length=1000
----

Also you can set a maximum length of all Event's details by using the `--spi-events-store-jpa-max-field-length` argument. This setting is useful if you want to adhere to the underlying storage limitation. For example:

[source,bash]
----
kc.[sh|bat] --spi-events-store-jpa-max-field-length=2500
----
