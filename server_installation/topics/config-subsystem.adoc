[[_manage_config]]

== Managing the subsystem configuration

Low-level configuration of {project_name} is done by editing the
 `standalone.xml`, `standalone-ha.xml`, or `domain.xml` file 
in your distribution.  The location of this file 
depends on your <<_operating-mode, operating mode>>.

While there are endless settings you can configure here, this section will focus on 
configuration of the _keycloak-server_ subsystem.  No matter which configuration file
you are using, configuration of the _keycloak-server_ subsystem is the same.

The keycloak-server subsystem is typically declared toward the end of the file like this:
[source,xml]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:keycloak-server:1.1">
   <web-context>auth</web-context>
   ...
</subsystem>
----

Note that anything changed in this subsystem will not take effect until the server is rebooted.
