== Setting up the network

The default installation of {project_name} can run with some networking limitations.  For one, all network endpoints bind to `localhost`
so the auth server is really only usable on one local machine.  For HTTP based connections, it does not use default ports
like 80 and 443.  HTTPS/SSL is not configured out of the box and without it, {project_name} has many security
vulnerabilities.
Finally, {project_name}
may often need to make secure SSL and HTTPS connections to external servers and thus need a trust store set up so that endpoints can
be validated correctly.  This chapter discusses all of these things.
