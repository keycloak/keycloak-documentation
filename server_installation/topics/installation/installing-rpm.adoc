=== Installing RH-SSO from an RPM

NOTE: With Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8, the term channel was replaced with the term repository. In these instructions only the term repository is used.

You must subscribe to both the {appserver_name} {appserver_version} and RH-SSO {project_versionDoc} repositories before you can install RH-SSO from an RPM.

NOTE: You cannot continue to receive upgrades to EAP RPMs but stop receiving updates for RH-SSO.

==== Subscribing to the {appserver_name} {appserver_version} repository

.Prerequisites

. Ensure that your Red Hat Enterprise Linux system is registered to your account using Red Hat Subscription Manager. For more information see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_subscription_management/1/html-single/quick_registration_for_rhel/index[Red Hat Subscription Management documentation].

. If you are already subscribed to another {appserver_name} repository, you must unsubscribe from that repository first.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7: Using Red Hat Subscription Manager, subscribe to the {appserver_name} {appserver_version} repository using the following command. Replace <RHEL_VERSION> with either 6 or 7 depending on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux version.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable=jb-eap-{appserver_version}-for-rhel-<RHEL_VERSION>-server-rpms --enable=rhel-<RHEL_VERSION>-server-rpms
----

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: Using Red Hat Subscription Manager, subscribe to the {appserver_name} {appserver_version} repository using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable=jb-eap-{appserver_version}-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
----

==== Subscribing to the RH-SSO {project_versionDoc} repository and installing RH-SSO {project_versionDoc}

.Prerequisites

. Ensure that your Red Hat Enterprise Linux system is registered to your account using Red Hat Subscription Manager.
