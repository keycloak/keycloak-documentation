=== Recommended network architecture

The recommended network architecture for deploying {project_name} is to set up an HTTP/HTTPS load balancer on
a public IP address that routes requests to {project_name} servers sitting on a private network.  This
isolates all clustering connections and provides a nice means of protecting the servers.

NOTE: By default, there is nothing to prevent unauthorized nodes from joining the cluster and broadcasting multicast messages.
      This is why cluster nodes should be in a private network, with a firewall protecting them from outside attacks.
