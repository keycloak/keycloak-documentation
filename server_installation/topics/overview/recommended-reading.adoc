=== Recommended additional external documentation

{project_name} is built on top of the {appserver_name} application server and its sub-projects like Infinispan (for caching) and Hibernate (for persistence).
This guide only covers basics for infrastructure-level configuration.  It is highly recommended that you peruse the documentation
for {appserver_name} and its sub projects. Here is the link to the documentation:

* link:{appserver_admindoc_link}[_{appserver_admindoc_name}_]
