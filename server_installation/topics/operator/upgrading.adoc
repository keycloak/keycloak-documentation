=== Upgrade strategy

You can configure how the operator performs {project_name} upgrades. You can choose from the following upgrade strategies.

* `recreate`: This is the default strategy. The operator removes all {project_name} replicas, optionally creates a backup
  and then creates the replicas based on a newer {project_name} image. This strategy is suitable for major upgrades as
  a single {project_name} version is accessing the underlying database. The downside is {project_name} needs to be shut
  down during the upgrade.
* `rolling`: The operator removes one replica at a time and creates it again based on a newer {project_name} image. This
  ensures a zero-downtime upgrade but is more suitable for minor version upgrades that do not require database migration
  since the database is accessed by multiple {project_name} versions concurrently. Automatic backups are not supported
  with this strategy.

.Example YAML file for a Keycloak custom resource
```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: example-keycloak
  labels:
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
   app: keycloak
endif::[]
ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
   app: sso
endif::[]
spec:
  instances: 2
  migration:
    strategy: recreate
    backups:
      enabled: True
  externalAccess:
    enabled: True
```

[NOTE]
====
Due to a https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator/issues/566[bug] introduced in a previous version of the Operator, `Selector` field on the {project_name} StatefulSet might
be misconfigured depending on your configuration. If such state is detected by the Operator and you are using the `recreate`
strategy, it will **delete and recreate the StatefulSet** with the correct `Selector` field. This is required as the
`Selector` field is immutable.

As a "delete" operation can have potentially dangerous side effects in very rare cases, for example when you have added custom
functionality unknown to the Operator to the StatefulSet definition, you can instead delete the StatefulSet manually.
