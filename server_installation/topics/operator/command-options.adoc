=== Command options for managing custom resources

After you create a custom request, you can edit it or delete using the `{create_cmd_brief}` command.

* To edit a custom request, use this command: `{create_cmd_brief} edit <CR-name>`
* To delete a custom request, use this command: `{create_cmd_brief} delete <CR-name>`

For example, to edit a realm custom request named `test-realm`, use this command:

[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd_brief} edit test-realm
----

A window opens where you can make changes.

[NOTE]
====
You can update the YAML file and changes appear in the {project_name} admin console, however changes to the admin console do not update the custom resource.
