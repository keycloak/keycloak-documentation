[[_backup-cr]]
=== Scheduling database backups

You can use the Operator to schedule automatic backups of the database as defined by custom resources. The custom resource triggers a backup job
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
(or a `CronJob` in the case of Periodic Backups)
endif::[]
and reports back its status.

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
Two options exist to schedule backups:

* xref:_backups-cr-aws[Backing up to AWS S3 storage]
* xref:_backups-local-cr[Backing up to local storage]

If you have AWS S3 storage, you can perform a one-time backup or periodic backups. If you do not have AWS S3 storage, you can back up to local storage.

[[_backups-cr-aws]]
==== Backing up to AWS S3 storage

You can back up your database to AWS S3 storage one time or periodically. To back up your data periodically, enter a valid `CronJob` into the `schedule`.

For AWS S3 storage, you create a YAML file for the backup custom resource and a YAML file for the AWS secret. The backup custom resource requires a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: KeycloakBackup
metadata:
  name: <CR Name>
spec:
  aws:
    # Optional - used only for Periodic Backups.
    # Follows usual crond syntax (for example, use "0 1 * * *" to perform the backup every day at 1 AM.)
    schedule: <Cron Job Schedule>
    # Required - the name of the secret containing the credentials to access the S3 storage
    credentialsSecretName: <A Secret containing S3 credentials>
```

The AWS secret requires a YAML file with the following structure:

.AWS S3 `Secret`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <Secret Name>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: <S3 Bucket Name>
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <AWS Access Key ID>
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <AWS Secret Key>
```

.Prerequisites

* Your Backup custom resource YAML file includes a `credentialsSecretName` that references a `Secret` containing AWS S3 credentials.

* Your `KeycloakBackup` custom resource has `aws` sub-properties.

* You have a YAML file for the AWS S3 Secret that includes a `<Secret Name>` that matches the one identified in the backup custom resource.

* You have cluster-admin permission or an equivalent level of permissions granted by an administrator.


.Procedure

. Create the secret with credentials: `{create_cmd} -f <secret_for_aws>.yaml`. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd} -f secret.yaml
keycloak.keycloak.org/aws_s3_secret created
----

. Create a backup job: `{create_cmd} -f <backup_crname>.yaml`. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd} -f aws_one-time-backup.yaml
keycloak.keycloak.org/aws_s3_backup created
----

. View a list of backup jobs:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]

----

. View the log of your completed backup job:

----
$ {create_cmd_brief} logs aws_s3_backup-5b4rf

The status of the backup job also appears in the AWS console.

[[_backups-local-cr]]
==== Backing up to Local Storage

endif::[]
You can use Operator to create a backup job that performs a one-time backup to a local Persistent Volume.

.Example YAML file for a Backup custom resource
```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: KeycloakBackup
metadata:
  name: test-backup
```

.Prerequisites

* You have a YAML file for this custom resource.
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
Be sure to omit the `aws` sub-properties from this file.
endif::[]

* You have a `PersistentVolume` with a `claimRef` to reserve it only for a `PersistentVolumeClaim` created by the {project_name} Operator.

.Procedure

. Create a backup job: `{create_cmd} -f <backup_crname>`. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd} -f one-time-backup.yaml
keycloak.keycloak.org/test-backup
----
+
The Operator creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with the following naming scheme:  `Keycloak-backup-<CR-name>`.
