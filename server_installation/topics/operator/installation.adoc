[[_install_by_command]]
==== Installing from the command line

You can install the {project_operator} from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster-admin permission or an equivalent level of permissions granted by an administrator.

.Procedure

. Obtain the software to install from this location: link:{operatorRepo_link}[Github repo].

. Install all required custom resource definitions:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd} -f deploy/crds/
----

. Create a new namespace (or reuse an existing one) such as the namespace `myproject`:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd_brief} create namespace myproject
----

. Deploy a role, role binding, and service account for the Operator:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd} -f deploy/role.yaml -n myproject
$ {create_cmd} -f deploy/role_binding.yaml -n myproject
$ {create_cmd} -f deploy/service_account.yaml -n myproject
----

. Deploy the Operator:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd} -f deploy/operator.yaml -n myproject
----

. Confirm that the Operator is running:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ {create_cmd_brief} get deployment keycloak-operator -n myproject
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
keycloak-operator   1/1     1            1           41s
----
endif::[]
.Additional resources

* When the Operator installation completes, you are ready to create your first custom resource. See xref:_keycloak_cr[{project_name} installation using a custom resource].
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]

[[_operator_production_usage]]
=== Using the {project_operator} in production environment

* The usage of embedded DB is not supported in a production environment.
* Backup CRD is deprecated and not supported in a production environment.
* We fully support using the rest of the CRDs in production, despite the `v1alpha1` version. We do not plan to make any breaking changes in this CRDs version.
