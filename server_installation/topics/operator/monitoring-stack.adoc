=== The {application_monitoring_operator}

Before using the Operator to install {project_name} or create components, we recommend that you install the {application_monitoring_operator}, which tracks Operator activity. To view metrics for the Operator, you can use the Grafana Dashboard and Prometheus Alerts from the {application_monitoring_operator}. For example, you can view metrics such as the number of controller runtime reconciliation loops, the reconcile loop time, and errors.

The {project_operator} integration with the {application_monitoring_operator} requires no action. You only need to install the {application_monitoring_operator} in the cluster.

==== Installing the {application_monitoring_operator}

.Prerequisites

* The {project_operator} is installed.

* You have cluster-admin permission or an equivalent level of permissions granted by an administrator.

.Procedure

. Install the {application_monitoring_operator} by using the link:{application_monitoring_operator_installation_link}[documentation].

. Annotate the namespace used for the {project_operator} installation. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
{create_cmd_brief} label namespace <namespace> monitoring-key=middleware
----

. Log into the OpenShift web console.

. Confirm monitoring is working by searching for Prometheus and Grafana route in the `application-monitoring` namespace.

==== Viewing Operator Metrics

Grafana and Promotheus each provide graphical information about Operator activities.

* The Operator installs a pre-defined Grafana Dashboard as shown here:

[NOTE]
====
If you make customizations, we recommend that you clone the Grafana Dashboard so that your changes are not overwritten during an upgrade.

* The Operator installs a set of pre-defined Prometheus Alerts as shown here:
