=== Monitoring Stack

{project_operator} integrates with {application_monitoring_operator} providing Graphana Dashboard and Prometheus Alerts. The integration is seamless and doesn't require any action from the user. However, {application_monitoring_operator} needs to be properly installed in the cluster.

==== Installing {application_monitoring_operator}

Prior to running {project_operator} it is recommended to install {application_monitoring_operator} by following the link:{application_monitoring_operator_installation_link}[documentation]. After {application_monitoring_operator} is up and running, you need to annotate the namespace used for {project_operator} installation. Here's an example:

.Annotating namespace for monitoring
```bash
oc label namespace <namespace> monitoring-key=middleware
```

Once the {application_monitoring_operator} is installed and running, also the corresponding namespace is annotated for monitoring, you can search for Prometheus and Graphana route in `application-monitoring` namespace:

==== Graphana Dashboard

{project_operator} installs a pre-defined Graphana Dashboard. Here's how it looks like:

NOTE: Graphana Dashboard is likely to be changed in future releases. If you need any customizations, please clone it and adjust to your needs.

==== Prometheus Alerts

{project_operator} installs a set of pre-defined Prometheus Alerts. Here's how they look like:
