== Use of the public hostname

{project_name} uses the public hostname for a number of things. For example, in the token issuer fields and URLs sent in
password reset emails.

The Hostname SPI provides a way to configure the hostname for a request. The default provider allows setting
a fixed URL for frontend requests, while allowing backend requests to be based on the request URI. It is also possible
to develop your own provider in the case the built-in provider does not provide the functionality needed.


=== Default provider

The default hostname provider uses the configured `frontendUrl` as the base URL for frontend requests (requests from
user-agents) and uses the request URL as the basis for backend requests (direct requests from clients).

Frontend request do not have to have the same context-path as the Keycloak server. This means you can expose Keycloak
on for example `https://auth.example.org` or `https://example.org/keycloak` while internally its URL could be
`https://10.0.0.10:8080/auth`.

This makes it possible to have user-agents (browsers) send requests to {project_name} through the public domain name,
while internal clients can use an internal domain name or IP address.

This is reflected in the OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint for example where the `authorization_endpoint` uses the
frontend URL, while `token_endpoint` uses the backend URL. As a note here a public client for instance would contact
Keycloak through the public endpoint, which would result in the base of `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint`
being the same.

To set the frontendUrl for Keycloak you can either pass add `-Dkeycloak.frontendUrl=https://auth.example.org` to the
startup or you can configure it in `standalone.xml`. See the example below:

[source, xml]
----
<spi name="hostname">
    <default-provider>default</default-provider>
    <provider name="default" enabled="true">
        <properties>
            <property name="frontendUrl" value="https://auth.example.com"/>
            <property name="forceBackendUrlToFrontendUrl" value="false"/>
        </properties>
    </provider>
</spi>
----

To update the `frontendUrl` with jboss-cli use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=hostname/provider=default:write-attribute(name=properties.frontendUrl,value="https://auth.example.com")
----

If you want all requests to go through the public domain name you can force backend requests to use the frontend URL as
well by setting `forceBackendUrlToFrontendUrl` to `true`.

It is also possible to override the default frontend URL for individual realms. This can be done in the admin console.

If you do not want to expose the admin endpoints and console on the public domain use the property `adminUrl` to set
a fixed URL for the admin console, which is different to the `frontendUrl`. It is also required to block access to
`/auth/admin` externally, for details on how to do that refer to the link:{adminguide_link}[{adminguide_name}].

=== Custom provider

To develop a custom hostname provider you need to implement `org.keycloak.urls.HostnameProviderFactory` and
`org.keycloak.urls.HostnameProvider`.

for more information on how to develop a custom provider.
