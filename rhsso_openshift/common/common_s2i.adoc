The image includes S2I scripts and maven.

Maven is currently only supported as a build tool for applications
that are supposed to be deployed on JBoss EAP-based containers (or
related/descendant images) on OpenShift.

Only WAR deployments are supported at this time.

==== Custom configuration

It is possible to add custom configuration files for the image. All
files put into configuration/ directory will be copied into
`$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/`. For example to override the
default configuration used in the image, just add a custom
standalone-openshift.xml into the configuration/ directory.
https://github.com/goldmann/openshift-eap-examples/tree/master/custom-configuration[See
example] for such deployment.

===== Custom modules

It is possible to add custom modules. All files from the
modules/Ã‚ directory will be copied into `$JBOSS_HOME/modules/`.
https://github.com/goldmann/openshift-eap-examples/tree/master/custom-module[See
example] for such deployment.

==== Deployment Artifacts

By default, artifacts from the source `target` directory will be deployed. To deploy from
different directories set the ARTIFACT_DIR environment variable in the BuildConfig 
definition. ARTIFACT_DIR is a comma-delimited list. For example: 
ARTIFACT_DIR=app1/target,app2/target,app3/target

==== Artifact Repository Mirrors

// Define required 'bcname' attribute for maven_mirror_url.adoc page
:bcname: eap

// Include the Artifact Repository Mirros section
// (MAVEN_MIRROR_URL variable usage information)
include::maven_mirror_url.adoc[bcname]

==== Scripts

`run`:: runs the container without any changes to the default
configuration, this means that the standalone-ha.xml configuration will
be used.
`assemble`:: uses Maven to build the source, create a package (war) and
move it to the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments` directory.

==== Environment variables

You can influence the way the build is executed by supplying environment
variables to the `s2i build` command. See the
link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md[s2i
docs] for more information. The environment variables that can be supplied are:

|===
|Variable name |Description |Example value

include::common_s2i_env_vars.adoc[]

|*_APP_DATADIR_*
| If defined, directory in the source from where data files are copied.
|*_mydata_*

|*_DATA_DIR_*
| Directory in the image where data from `$APP_DATADIR` will be copied.
|*_$JBOSS_HOME/data_*

|===

==== Example

This example for the JBoss EAP 6.4 image builds the Heroku Java example

----
s2i build -e "MAVEN_ARGS=clean package" --loglevel=5 --forcePull=false https://github.com/heroku/java-sample.git ce-registry.usersys.redhat.com/jboss-eap-6/eap-openshift:6.4 test-jee-app
----

Later you can run the application with:

----
docker run -it --rm test-jee-app
----

This will run a container and deploy the hello world application on start-up.
