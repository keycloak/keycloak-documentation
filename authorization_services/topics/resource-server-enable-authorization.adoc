The Authorization tab contains additional sub-tabs covering the different steps that you must follow to actually protect your application's resources. Each tab is covered separately by a specific topic in this documentation. But here is a quick description about each one:

* *Settings*

General settings for your resource server. For more details about this page see the xref:resource_server_settings[Resource Server Settings] section.

* *Resource*

From this page, you can manage your application's <<_resource_overview, resources>>.

* *Authorization Scopes*
+
From this page, you can manage <<_resource_overview, scopes>>.

* *Policies*
+
From this page, you can manage <<_policy_overview, authorization policies>> and define the conditions that must be met to grant a permission.

* *Permissions*
+
From this page, you can manage the <<_permission_overview, permissions>> for your protected resources and scopes by linking them with the policies you created.

== Resource Server Settings

On the Resource Server Settings page, you can configure the policy enforcement mode, allow remote resource management, and export the authorization configuration settings.

* *Policy Enforcement Mode*

Specifies how policies are enforced when processing authorization requests sent to the server.
+
** *Enforcing*
+
(default mode) Requests are denied by default even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
+
** *Permissive*
+
Requests are allowed even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
+
** *Disabled*
+
Disables the evaluation of all policies and allows access to all resources.
+
* *Remote Resource Management*
+
Specifies whether resources can be managed remotely by the resource server. If false, resources can be managed only from the administration console.
