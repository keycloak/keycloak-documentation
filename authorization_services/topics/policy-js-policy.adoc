= JavaScript-Based Policy

You can use this type of policy to define conditions for your permissions using JavaScript. It is one of the rule-based policy types
supported by {project_name}, and provides flexibility to write any policy based on the <<_policy_evaluation_api, Evaluation API>>.

To create a new JavaScript-based policy, select *JavaScript* in the dropdown list in the upper right corner of the policy listing.

== Configuration

* *Name*
+
A human-readable and unique string describing the policy. A best practice is to use names that are closely related to your business and security requirements, so you
can identify them more easily.
+
* *Description*
+
A string containing details about this policy.
+
* *Code*
+
The JavaScript code providing the conditions for this policy.
+
* *Logic*
+
The <<_policy_logic, Logic>> of this policy to apply after the other conditions have been evaluated.

== Examples

=== Checking for attributes from the evaluation context
Here is a simple example of a JavaScript-based policy that uses attribute-based access control (ABAC) to define a condition based on an attribute
obtained from the execution context:

```javascript
var context = $evaluation.getContext();
var contextAttributes = context.getAttributes();

if (contextAttributes.containsValue('kc.client.network.ip_address', '127.0.0.1')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

=== Checking for attributes from the current identity
Here is a simple example of a JavaScript-based policy that uses attribute-based access control (ABAC) to define a condition based on an attribute
obtained associated with the current identity:

```javascript
var context = $evaluation.getContext();
var identity = context.getIdentity();
var attributes = identity.getAttributes();
var email = attributes.getValue('email').asString(0);

if (email.endsWith('@keycloak.org')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

Where these attributes are mapped from whatever claim is defined in the token that was used in the authorization request.

=== Checking for roles granted to the current identity
You can also use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in your policies. In the example below, we check if a user is granted with a `keycloak_user` *realm* role:

```javascript
var context = $evaluation.getContext();
var identity = context.getIdentity();

if (identity.hasRealmRole('keycloak_user')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

Or you can check if a user is granted with a `my-client-role` *client* role, where `my-client` is the client id of the client application:

```javascript
var context = $evaluation.getContext();
var identity = context.getIdentity();

if (identity.hasClientRole('my-client', 'my-client-role')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

=== Checking for roles granted to an user
To check for realm roles granted to an user:

```javascript
var realm = $evaluation.getRealm();

if (realm.isUserInRealmRole('marta', 'role-a')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

Or for client roles granted to an user:

```javascript
var realm = $evaluation.getRealm();

if (realm.isUserInClientRole('marta', 'my-client', 'some-client-role')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

=== Checking for roles granted to a group
To check for realm roles granted to a group:

```javascript
var realm = $evaluation.getRealm();

if (realm.isGroupInRole('/Group A/Group D', 'role-a')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

=== Pushing arbitrary claims to the resource server
To push arbitrary claims to the resource server in order to provide additional information on how permissions should be
enforced:

```javascript
var permission = $evaluation.getPermission();

// decide if permission should be granted

if (granted) {
    permission.addClaim('claim-a', 'claim-a');
    permission.addClaim('claim-a', 'claim-a1');
    permission.addClaim('claim-b', 'claim-b');
}

```

=== Checking for group membership

```javascript
var realm = $evaluation.getRealm();

if (realm.isUserInGroup('marta', '/Group A/Group B')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

=== Mixing different access control mechanisms
You can also use a combination of several access control mechanisms. The example below shows how roles(RBAC) and
claims/attributes(ABAC) checks can be used within the same policy. In this case we check if user is granted with `admin` role
or has an e-mail from `keycloak.org` domain:

```javascript
var context = $evaluation.getContext();
var identity = context.getIdentity();
var attributes = identity.getAttributes();
var email = attributes.getValue('email').asString(0);

if (identity.hasRealmRole('admin') || email.endsWith('@keycloak.org')) {
    $evaluation.grant();
}
```

NOTE: When writing your own rules, keep in mind that the *$evaluation* object is an object implementing *org.keycloak.authorization.policy.evaluation.Evaluation*. For more information about what you can access from this interface, see the <<_policy_evaluation_api, Evaluation API>>.
