. On the Client Details page, click the *Authorization Enabled* switch to *ON*, and then click *Save*.
A new *Authorization* tab is displayed for the client.

When you enable authorization services for a client application, {project_name} automatically creates several <<_resource_server_default_config, default settings>> for your client authorization configuration.

For more information about authorization configuration, see <<_resource_server_enable_authorization, Enabling Authorization Services>>.
