= Managing Policies

As mentioned previously, policies define the conditions that must be satisfied before granting access to an object.

You can view all policies associated with a resource server by clicking the *Policy* tab when editing a resource server.

On this tab, you can view the list of previously created policies as well as create and edit a policy.

To create a new policy, in the upper right corner of the policy list, select a policy type from the `Create policy` dropdown list. Details about each policy type are described in this section.
