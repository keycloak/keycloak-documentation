= Creating scope-based permissions

A scope-based permission defines a set of one or more scopes to protect using a set of one or more authorization policies. Unlike resource-based permissions, you can use this permission type to create permissions not only for a resource, but also for the scopes associated with it, providing more granularity when defining the permissions that govern your resources and the actions that can be performed on them.
