= Creating a Realm and a User

The first step in this tutorial is to create a realm and a user in that realm. Then, within the realm we will create a single client application, which then becomes a <<_overview_terminology, resource server>> for which you need to enable authorization services.

To create a realm and a user complete the following steps:

. Create a realm with a name *hello-world-authz*. Once created, a page similar to the following is displayed:
+
.Realm hello-world-authz

. Create a user for your newly created realm. Click *Users*. The user list page opens.

. On the right side of the empty user list, click *Add User*.

. To create a new user, complete the *Username*, *Email*, *First Name*, and *Last Name* fields.
Click the *User Enabled* switch to *On*, and then click *Save*.

.Add User

. Set a password for the user by clicking the *Credentials* tab.
+
.Set User Password

. Complete the *New Password* and *Password Confirmation* fields with a password and click the *Temporary* switch to *OFF*.

. Click *Reset Password* to set the user's password.
