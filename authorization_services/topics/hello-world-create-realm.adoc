= Creating a realm and a user

The first step in this tutorial is to create a realm and a user in that realm. Then, within the realm we will create a single client application, which then becomes a <<_overview_terminology, resource server>> for which you need to enable authorization services.

.Procedure

. Create a realm with a name *hello-world-authz*. Once created, a page similar to the following is displayed:
+
.Realm hello-world-authz
