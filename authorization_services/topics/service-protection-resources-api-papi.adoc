= Managing Resources

Resource servers can manage their resources remotely using a UMA-compliant endpoint.

```
http://${host}:${port}/auth/realms/${realm_name}/authz/protection/resource_set
```

This endpoint provides operations outlined as follows (entire path omitted for clarity):

* Create resource set description: POST /resource_set
* Read resource set description: GET /resource_set/{_id}
* Update resource set description: PUT /resource_set/{_id}
* Delete resource set description: DELETE /resource_set/{_id}
* List resource set descriptions: GET /resource_set

For more information about the contract for each of these operations, see https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0-09.html#reg-api[UMA Resource Registration API].
