[[_enforcer_bearer]]
= Protecting a Stateless Service Using a Bearer Token

If the adapter is configured with the `bearer-only` configuration option, the policy enforcer decides whether a request
to access a protected resource is allowed or denied based on the permissions of the bearer token.

. HTTP GET example passing an RPT as a bearer token
```bash
GET /my-resource-server/my-protected-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: host.com
Authorization: Bearer ${RPT}
...
```

In this example, a *keycloak.json* file in your application is similar to the following:

.Example of WEB-INF/keycloak.json with the bearer-only configuration option
```json
...
"bearer-only" : true,
...
```

== Authorization Response

When a client tries to access a resource server with a bearer token that is lacking permissions to access a protected resource, the resource server
responds with a *401* status code and a `WWW-Authenticate` header. The value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header depends on the authorization protocol
in use by the resource server.

Here is an example of a response from a resource server that is using UMA as the authorization protocol:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: UMA realm="photoz-restful-api",as_uri="https://${host}:${post}/auth/realms/${realm}",ticket="${PERMISSION_TICKET}"
```

Once  a client receives a response from the server, it examines the status code and `WWW-Authenticate` header to obtain an RPT from the {project_name} Server.
