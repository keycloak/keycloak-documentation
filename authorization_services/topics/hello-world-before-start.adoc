= Before You Start

This guide is based on the *{project_name} Demo Distribution*. Download the demo distribution before proceeding.

[NOTE]
This guide assumes that you are already familiar with {project_name} and that you are able to install and boot a {project_name} Server. For more information, see https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/getting-started-tutorials/content/[the Getting Started tutorials].

Ensure you have a {project_name} instance running; the default configuration is http://localhost:8080/auth[http://localhost:8080/auth]. After logging in to the
Administration Console, a page similar to this one is displayed:

.{project_name} Administration Console
image:{project_images}/getting-started/kc-start-page.png[alt="{project_name} Administration Console"]

The source code for the getting started tutorials can be obtained from the demo distributions. The authorization-related examples
are located at *${KEYCLOAK_DEMO_SERVER_DIR}/examples/authz*.
