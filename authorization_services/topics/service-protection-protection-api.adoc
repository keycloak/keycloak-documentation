[[_service_protection_api]]
= Protection API

The Protection API provides a UMA-compliant set of endpoints providing:

* *Resource Management*
+
With this endpoint, resource servers can manage their resources remotely and enable <<_enforcer_overview, policy enforcers>> to query the server for the resources that need protection.

* *Permission Management*
+
In the UMA protocol, resource servers access this endpoint to create permission tickets. {project_name} also provides
endpoints to manage the state of permissions and query permissions.

An important requirement for this API is that _only_ resource servers are allowed to access its endpoints using a special OAuth2 access token called a protection API token (PAT).
In UMA, a PAT is a token with the scope *uma_protection*.
