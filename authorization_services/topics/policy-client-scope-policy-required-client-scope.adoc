= Defining a client scope as required

When creating a client scope-based policy, you can specify a specific client scope as `Required`. When you do that, the policy will grant access only if the client requesting access has been granted *all* the *required* client scopes.

To specify a client scope as required, select the `Required` checkbox for the client scope you want to configure as required.

Required client scopes can be useful when your policy defines multiple client scopes but only a subset of them are mandatory.
