= Build, deploy, and test your application

Now that the *app-authz-vanilla* resource server (or client) is properly configured and authorization services are enabled, it can be deployed to the server.

The project and code for the application you are going to deploy is available in link:{quickstartRepo_link}[{quickstartRepo_name}].  You will need the following
installed on your machine and available in your PATH before you can continue:

* Java JDK 8
* Apache Maven 3.1.1 or higher
* Git

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
You can obtain the code by cloning the repository at {quickstartRepo_link}. The quickstarts are designed to work with the most recent Keycloak release.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
You can obtain the code by cloning the repository at {quickstartRepo_link}. Use the branch matching the version of {project_name} in use.
endif::[]

Follow these steps to download the code.

.Clone Project
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ git clone {quickstartRepo_link}
----

The application we are about to build and deploy is located at

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd {quickstartRepo_dir}/app-authz-jee-vanilla
----

== Obtaining the adapter configuration

You must first obtain the adapter configuration before building and deploying the application.

.Procedure

. Log into the Admin Console.

. Click *Clients* in the menu.

. In the client listing, click the *app-authz-vanilla* client application. The Client Settings page opens.
+
.Client Settings
image:images/getting-started/hello-world/enable-authz.png[alt="Client Settings"]

. From the *Action* list, select *Download adapter config*.
. From the Format Option list, select *Keycloak OIDC JSON*.
+
The adapter configuration is displayed in JSON format.

. Click *Download*.
+
.Adapter configuration

. Move the file `keycloak.json` to the `app-authz-jee-vanilla/config` directory.

. Optionally, specify a redirection URL.
+
By default, the policy enforcer responds with a `403` status code when the user lacks permission to access protected resources on the resource server. However, you can also specify a redirection URL for unauthorized users. To specify a redirection URL, edit the *keycloak.json* file that you updated and replace the `policy-enforcer` configuration with the following:
+
```json
"policy-enforcer": {
    "on-deny-redirect-to" : "/app-authz-vanilla/error.jsp"
}
```
+
This change specifies to the policy enforcer to redirect users to a `/app-authz-vanilla/error.jsp` page if a user does not have the necessary permissions to access a protected resource, rather than an unhelpful `403 Unauthorized` message.

== Building and deploying the application

To build and deploy the application execute the following command:

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd {quickstartRepo_dir}/app-authz-jee-vanilla
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

== Testing the application

If your application was successfully deployed, you can access it at http://localhost:8080/app-authz-vanilla[http://localhost:8080/app-authz-vanilla]. The {project_name} Login page opens.

.Login page
image:images/getting-started/hello-world/login-page.png[alt="Login page"]

.Procedure

. Log in as *alice* using the password you specified for that user. The following page is displayed:
+
.Hello World Authz main page
image:images/getting-started/hello-world/main-page.png[alt="Hello World Authz main page"]
+
The <<_resource_server_default_config, default settings>> defined by {project_name} when you enable authorization services for a client application provide a simple
policy that always grants access to the resources protected by this policy.

You can start by changing the default permissions and policies and test how your application responds, or even create new policies using the different
<<_policy_overview, policy types>> provided by {project_name}.

There are a plenty of things you can do now to test this application. For example, you can change the default policy by clicking
the `Authorization` tab for the client, then client on the `Policies` tab, then click on the `Default Policy` in the list.
Now we are going to change the `Logic` to `Negative` using the dropdown list in this page.

. Log out of the demo application and log in again.
+
You can no longer access the application.

== Next steps

There are additional things you can do, such as:

* Create a scope, define a policy and permission for it, and test it on the application side. Can the user perform an action (or anything else represented by the scope you created)?
* Create different types of policies and associate these policies with the `Default Permission`.
* Apply multiple policies to the `Default Permission` and test the behavior. For example, combine multiple policies and change the `Decision Strategy` accordingly.
