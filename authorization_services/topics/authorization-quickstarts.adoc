= Authorization Quickstarts

In addition to the *app-authz-jee-vanilla* quickstart that was used as a sample application in the previous section, the
link:{quickstartRepo_link}[{quickstartRepo_name}] contains other applications that make use of the authorization services
described in this documentation.

The authorization quickstarts have been designed so that authorization services are displayed in different scenarios and
using different technologies and integrations. It is not meant as a comprehensive set of all the possible use cases involving
authorization but they should provide a starting point for users interested in understanding how the authorization services
can be used in their own applications.

Each quickstart has a `README` file with instructions on how to build, deploy, and test the sample application. The following
table provides a brief description of the available authorization quickstarts:
