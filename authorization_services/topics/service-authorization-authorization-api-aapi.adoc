[[_service_authorization_api_aapi]]
= Requesting Authorization Data and Token

Client applications using the UMA protocol can use a specific endpoint to obtain a special security token called a <<_service_rpt_overview, Requesting Party Token (RPT)>>.
This token consists of all the permissions granted to a user as a result of the evaluation of the permissions and authorization policies associated with the resources being requested.
With an RPT, client applications can gain access to protected resources at the resource server.

.UMA compliant Authorization API Endpoint
```bash
http://${host}:${port}/auth/realms/${realm_name}/authz/authorize
```

When requesting an RPT, you need to provide two things:

* A <<_service_protection_permission_api_papi, permission ticket>> representing the resources you want to access
* The <<_service_authorization_aat, Authorization API token (AAT)>> (as a bearer token) representing a user's identity and his consent to access authorization data on his behalf.

The permission ticket is added to an HTTP request as a parameter whether the AAT is included in a ```Authorization``` header in order to authenticate the request
using the AAT as a bearer token.

```bash
curl -X POST
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AAT}" -d '{
    "ticket" : ${PERMISSION_TICKET}
}' "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/hello-world-authz/authz/authorize"
```

As a result, the server response is:

```json
{"rpt":"${RPT}"}
```
