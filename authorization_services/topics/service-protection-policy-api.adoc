= Managing resource permissions using the Policy API

{project_name} leverages the UMA Protection API to allow resource servers to manage permissions for their users. In addition
to the Resource and Permission APIs, {project_name} provides a Policy API from where permissions can be set to resources by resource
servers on behalf of their users.

The Policy API is available at:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://${host}:${port}{kc_realms_path}/${realm_name}/authz/protection/uma-policy/{resource_id}
----

This API is protected by a bearer token that must represent a consent granted by the user to the resource server to manage permissions on his behalf. The bearer token can be a regular access token obtained from the
token endpoint using:

* Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Type
* Token Exchange, in order to exchange an access token granted to some client (public client) for a token
where audience is the resource server

== Associating a permission with a resource

To associate a permission with a specific resource you must send a HTTP POST request as follows:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8180{kc_realms_path}/photoz/authz/protection/uma-policy/{resource_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$access_token \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"name": "Any people manager",
	"description": "Allow access to any people manager",
	"scopes": ["read"],
	"roles": ["people-manager"]
}'
----

In the example above we are creating and associating a new permission to a resource represented by `resource_id` where
any user with a role `people-manager` should be granted with the `read` scope.

You can also create policies using other access control mechanisms, such as using groups:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8180{kc_realms_path}/photoz/authz/protection/uma-policy/{resource_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$access_token \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"name": "Any people manager",
	"description": "Allow access to any people manager",
	"scopes": ["read"],
	"groups": ["/Managers/People Managers"]
}'
----

Or a specific client:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8180{kc_realms_path}/photoz/authz/protection/uma-policy/{resource_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$access_token \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"name": "Any people manager",
	"description": "Allow access to any people manager",
	"scopes": ["read"],
	"clients": ["my-client"]
}'
----

Or even using a custom policy using JavaScript:

:tech_feature_name: Upload Scripts
:tech_feature_setting: -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.upload_scripts=enabled
include::./templates/deprecated.adoc[]

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8180{kc_realms_path}/photoz/authz/protection/uma-policy/{resource_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$access_token \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"name": "Any people manager",
	"description": "Allow access to any people manager",
	"scopes": ["read"],
	"condition": "my-deployed-script.js"
}'
----

It is also possible to set any combination of these access control mechanisms.

To update an existing permission, send an HTTP PUT request as follows:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://localhost:8180{kc_realms_path}/photoz/authz/protection/uma-policy/{permission_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$access_token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "21eb3fed-02d7-4b5a-9102-29f3f09b6de2",
    "name": "Any people manager",
    "description": "Allow access to any people manager",
    "type": "uma",
    "scopes": [
        "album:view"
    ],
    "logic": "POSITIVE",
    "decisionStrategy": "UNANIMOUS",
    "owner": "7e22131a-aa57-4f5f-b1db-6e82babcd322",
    "roles": [
        "user"
    ]
}'
----

== Removing a permission

To remove a permission associated with a resource, send an HTTP DELETE request as follows:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8180{kc_realms_path}/photoz/authz/protection/uma-policy/{permission_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$access_token
----

== Querying permission

To query the permissions associated with a resource, send an HTTP GET request as follows:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://${host}:${port}{kc_realms_path}/${realm}/authz/protection/uma-policy?resource={resource_id}
----

To query the permissions given its name, send an HTTP GET request as follows:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://${host}:${port}{kc_realms_path}/${realm}/authz/protection/uma-policy?name=Any people manager
----

To query the permissions associated with a specific scope, send an HTTP GET request as follows:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://${host}:${port}{kc_realms_path}/${realm}/authz/protection/uma-policy?scope=read
----

To query all permissions, send an HTTP GET request as follows:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://${host}:${port}{kc_realms_path}/${realm}/authz/protection/uma-policy
----

When querying the server for permissions use parameters `first` and `max` results to limit the result.
