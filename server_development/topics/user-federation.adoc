[[_user_federation]]
== User Federation SPI

The keycloak examples directory contains an example of a simple User Federation Provider backed by a simple properties file. See `providers/federation-provider`
in the examples distribution. Most of how to create a federation provider is explained directly within the example code, but some information is here too.

Writing a User Federation Provider starts by implementing the `UserFederationProvider` and `UserFederationProviderFactory` interfaces. Please see the Javadoc
and example for complete details on how to do this.

Some important methods of note: getUserByUsername() and getUserByEmail() require that you query your federated storage and if the user exists create and import
the user into Keycloak storage. How much metadata you import is fully up to you. This import is done by invoking methods on the object returned by
`KeycloakSession.userFederatedStorage()` to add and import user information. The proxy() method will be called whenever Keycloak has found an imported UserModel.
This allows the federation provider to proxy the UserModel which is useful if you want to support external storage updates on demand. 

For details on how to package and deploy a custom provider refer to the <<providers.adoc#providers,Service Provider Interfaces>> chapter.
