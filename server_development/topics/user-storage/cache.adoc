=== User Caches

When a user object is loaded by ID, username, or email queries it is cached. When a user object is being cached, it iterates through
the entire `UserModel` interface and pulls this information to a local in-memory-only cache. In a cluster, this cache
is still local, but it becomes an invalidation cache. When a user object is modified, it is evicted. This eviction event
is propagated to the entire cluster so that the other nodes' user cache is also invalidated.

==== Managing the user cache

You can access the user cache by calling `KeycloakSession.userCache()`.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * All these methods effect an entire cluster of Keycloak instances.
 *
 * @author <a href="mailto:bill@burkecentral.com">Bill Burke</a>
 * @version $Revision: 1 $
 */
public interface UserCache extends UserProvider {
    /**
     * Evict user from cache.
     *
     * @param user
     */
    void evict(RealmModel realm, UserModel user);

    /**
     * Evict users of a specific realm
     *
     * @param realm
     */
    void evict(RealmModel realm);

    /**
     * Clear cache entirely.
     *
     */
    void clear();
}
----

There are methods for evicting specific users, users contained in a specific realm, or the entire cache.

==== OnUserCache Callback Interface

You might want to cache additional information that is specific to your provider implementation. The User Storage SPI
has a callback whenever a user is cached: `org.keycloak.models.cache.OnUserCache`.

[source,java]
----
public interface OnUserCache {
    void onCache(RealmModel realm, CachedUserModel user, UserModel delegate);
}
----

Your provider class should implement this interface if it wants this callback. The `UserModel` delegate parameter
is the `UserModel` instance returned by your provider. The `CachedUserModel` is an expanded `UserModel` interface.
This is the instance that is cached locally in local storage.

[source,java]
----
public interface CachedUserModel extends UserModel {

    /**
     * Invalidates the cache for this user and returns a delegate that represents the actual data provider
     *
     * @return
     */
    UserModel getDelegateForUpdate();

    boolean isMarkedForEviction();

    /**
     * Invalidate the cache for this model
     *
     */
    void invalidate();

    /**
     * When was the model was loaded from database.
     *
     * @return
     */
    long getCacheTimestamp();

    /**
     * Returns a map that contains custom things that are cached along with this model.  You can write to this map.
     *
     * @return
     */
    ConcurrentHashMap getCachedWith();
}
----

This `CachedUserModel` interface allows you to evict the user from the cache and get the provider `UserModel` instance.
The `getCachedWith()` method returns a map that allows you to cache additional information pertaining to the user. For example, credentials are not part of the `UserModel` interface. If you wanted to cache credentials in memory, you would implement `OnUserCache` and cache your user's credentials using the `getCachedWith()` method.

==== Cache policies

On the administration console management page for your user storage provider, you can specify a unique cache policy.
