= Upgrading the {project_name} Admin Client

[[_upgrade_admin_client]]

It is important that you upgrade the {project_name} server first, and then upgrade the admin-client. Earlier versions of the
admin-client might work with later versions of {project_name} server, but earlier versions of {project_name} server might not
work with later versions of the admin-client. It is recommended to use the admin-client version that matches the used 
{project_name} server version.
