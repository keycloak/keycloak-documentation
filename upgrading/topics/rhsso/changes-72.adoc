== RH-SSO 7.2

The following changes have occurred from RH-SSO 7.1 to RH-SSO 7.2.

=== New password hashing algorithms

We have added two new password hashing algorithms (pbkdf2-sha256 and pbkdf2-sha512). New realms will use the pbkdf2-sha256
hashing algorithm with 27500 hashing iterations. Since pbkdf2-sha256 is slightly faster than pbkdf2 the iterations was
increased to 27500 from 20000.

Existing realms are upgraded if the password policy contains the default value for the hashing algorithm (not specified) and
iteration (20000). If you have changed the hashing iterations, you need to manually change to pbkdf2-sha256 if you'd like
to use the more secure hashing algorithm.

=== ID Token requires scope=openid

In RH-SSO 7.0, the ID Token was returned regardless if `scope=openid` query parameter was present or not in authorization
request. This is incorrect according to the OpenID Connect specification.

In RH-SSO 7.1, we added this query parameter to adapters, but left the old behavior to accommodate migration.

In RH-SSO 7.2, this behavior has changed and the `scope=openid` query parameter is now required to mark the request as an
OpenID Connect request. If this query parameter is omitted the ID Token will not be generated.

=== Microsoft SQL Server requires extra dependency

Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 requires additional dependency added to the JDBC driver module. If you observe an
`NoClassDefFoundError` error when using Microsoft SQL Server please add the following dependency to your JDBC driver
`module.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<module name="javax.xml.bind.api"/>
----

=== Added session_state parameter to OpenID Connect Authentication Response

The OpenID Connect Session Management specification requires that the parameter `session_state` is present in the OpenID Connect Authentication Response.

In RH-SSO 7.1, we did not have this parameter, but now {project_name} adds this parameter by default, as required by the specification.

However, some OpenID Connect / OAuth2 adapters, and especially older {project_name} adapters (such as RH-SSO 7.1 and older), may have issues with this new parameter.

For example, the parameter will be always present in the browser URL after successful authentication to the client application.
If you use RH-SSO 7.1 or a legacy OAuth2 / OpenID Connect adapter, it may be useful to disable adding the `session_state` parameter to the authentication response.
This can be done for the particular client in the {project_name} admin console, in client details in the section with `OpenID Connect Compatibility Modes`,
described in <<_compatibility_with_older_adapters>>. There is the `Exclude Session State From Authentication Response` switch,
which can be turned on to prevent adding the `session_state` parameter to the Authentication Response.

=== Microsoft Identity Provider updated to use the Microsoft Graph API

The Microsoft Identity Provider implementation in {project_name} up to version 7.2.4 relies on the Live SDK
endpoints for authorization and obtaining the user profile. From November 2018 onwards, Microsoft is removing support
for the Live SDK API in favor of the new Microsoft Graph API. The {project_name} identity provider has been updated
to use the new endpoints so if this integration is in use make sure you upgrade to {project_name} version 7.2.5 or later.

Legacy client applications registered under "Live SDK applications" won't work with the Microsoft Graph endpoints
due to changes in the id format of the applications. If you run into an error saying that the application identifier
was not found in the directory, you will have to register the client application again in the
https://account.live.com/developers/applications/create[Microsoft Application Registration] portal to obtain a new application id.

=== Google Identity Provider updated to use Google Sign-in authentication system

The Google Identity Provider implementation in {project_name} up to version 7.2.5 relies on the Google+ API endpoints
endpoints for authorization and obtaining the user profile. From March 2019 onwards, Google is removing support
for the Google+ API in favor of the new Google Sign-in authentication system. The {project_name} identity provider has been updated
to use the new endpoints so if this integration is in use make sure you upgrade to {project_name} version 7.2.6 or later.

If you run into an error saying that the application identifier was not found in the directory, you will have to register the client application again in the
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials[Google API Console] portal to obtain a new application id and secret.

It is possible that you will need to adjust custom mappers for non-standard claims that were provided by Google+ user
information endpoint and are provided under different name by Google Sign-in API. Please consult Google documentation
for the most up-to-date information on available claims.

=== LinkedIn Social Broker updated to Version 2 of LinkedIn APIs

Accordingly with LinkedIn, all developers need to migrate to version 2.0 of their APIs and OAuth 2.0. As such, we have updated
our LinkedIn Social Broker so if this integration is in use make sure you upgrade to {project_name} version 7.2.6 or later.

Existing deployments using this broker may start experiencing errors when fetching user's profile using version 2 of
LinkedIn APIs. This error may be related with the lack of permissions granted to the client application used to configure the broker
which may not be authorized to access the Profile API or request specific OAuth2 scopes during the authentication process.

Even for newly created LinkedIn client applications, you need to make sure that the client is able to request the `r_liteprofile` and
`r_emailaddress` OAuth2 scopes, at least, as well that the client application can fetch current member's profile from the `https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me` endpoint.

Due to these privacy restrictions imposed by LinkedIn in regards to access to member's information and the limited set of claims returned by the
current member's Profile API, the LinkedIn Social Broker
is now using the member's email address as the default username. That means that the `r_emailaddress` is always set when
sending authorization requests during the authentication.
