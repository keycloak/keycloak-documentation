= Patching a local Maven installation

If you have installed the RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository using a ZIP file downloaded from the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal], it may also need to be patched.

The RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository is available online or as a downloaded ZIP file. If you use the publicly hosted online Maven repository, updates are automatically applied, and no action is required to update it. However, if you installed the Maven repository locally using the ZIP file, you are responsible for applying updates to the repository.

Whenever a cumulative patch is released for RH-SSO, a corresponding patch is provided for the RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository. This patch is available in the form of an incremental ZIP file that is unzipped into the existing local repository. It does not overwrite or remove any existing files, so there is no rollback requirement.

Use the following procedure to apply updates to your locally installed RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository.

== Prerequisites

* Valid access and subscription to the Red Hat Customer Portal.

* The RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository, previously downloaded and installed locally.

== Update a locally installed RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository

. Open a browser and log into the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

. Select *Downloads* from the menu at the top of the page.

. Select `Red Hat Single Sign-On` from the list.

. Select the correct version of Red Hat Single Sign-On from the Version drop-down menu, then select the *Patches* tab.

. Find `Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.x.y Client Adapters Incremental Maven Repository` from the list, where `x.y` match the cumulative patch number you want to update to. Select *Download*.

. Locate the path to your RH-SSO Client Adapters Maven Repository. This is referred to in the commands below as `RH-SSO_MAVEN_REPOSITORY_PATH`. Unzip the downloaded Maven patch file directly into this directory, like this:

.. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, open a terminal and run the following command, replacing the values for the cumulative patch number and your Maven repository path:
+
```
$ unzip -o rh-sso-7.x.y-incremental-maven-repository.zip  -d RH-SSO_MAVEN_REPOSITORY_PATH
```
+

.. For Microsoft Windows, use the Windows extraction utility to extract the ZIP file into the root of the `RH-SSO_MAVEN_REPOSITORY_PATH` directory.
