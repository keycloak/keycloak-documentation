= RESTEasy Version Update

Updated the RESTEasy version of Keycloak Admin REST Client to the next major version.

= H2 Version Update

{project_name} ships for development purposes with an H2 database driver.
As it is intended for development purposes only, it should never be used in a production environment.

In this release, the H2 driver has been upgraded from version 1.x to version 2.x.
This change might require changes to the H2 JDBC URL or migration of the H2 database files in an existing Keycloak setup.

== Changes to the H2 JDBC URL

For Keycloak to run with its JPA legacy store with H2 version 2.x, the JDBC URL requires the attribute `NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE`.

In a setup where H2 is initialized by Keycloak without extra parameters, Keycloak will append the attribute automatically.
This is the default for development setups.

If an H2 JDBC URL is provided on the command line or in a configuration file, and it already contains the `NON_KEYWORDS=` attribute in the JDBC URL, this attribute needs to be amended with the `VALUE` keyword.

If the connection factory for the H2 database is initialized outside Keycloak, that initialization needs to take care of adding the `NON_KEYWORDS` attribute.

See the H2 documentation http://www.h2database.com/html/commands.html#set_non_keywords[on the `NON_KEYWORDS` attribute] for details.

== Upgrade of H2 database files

H2 database base files created with H2 version 1.x should not be used with version 2.x.

Purge existing H2 database files to start with an empty database, export and import the realms using Keycloak's export and import functionality, or refer to the http://www.h2database.com/html/migration-to-v2.html[migration notes on the H2 database project's website] for details on how to migrate H2 database contents.

= Breaking changes in the new version of Keycloak Operator

NOTE: In order to use the newest version of the Keycloak Operator, the manual reinstallation and upgrade of your CRs are required. There’s no automated migration.

This release contains the following breaking changes in Keycloak CRs:

== serverConfiguration free-form field was renamed

From now on it’s called `additionalOptions`. The idea behind this decision is to align it more with the Keycloak Quarkus distribution and achieve/preserve a naming consistency.
`serverConfiguration` can be still used for configuring options that haven’t got a declared alternative in Keycloak custom resources (CRs). A good example of such use can be service providers.

== Ingress options were refined

In the past, it used to be defined via the `disableDefaultIngress` property. We decided to clarify it a bit, thus from now on you can use the following structure to control your ingress settings:

```yaml
spec:
    ...
    ingress:
      enabled: false
```

== HTTP options were added

Similarly, like with ingress, you can define multiple HTTP options in a better structural manner:

```yaml
spec:
    ...
  http:
    httpEnabled: true
    httpPort: 80
    httpsPort: 443
    tlsSecret: my-tls-secret
```

== Hostname options were added

Last but not least, the hostname options were also changed:

```yaml
spec:
    ...
  hostname:
    hostname: [keycloak-server-hostname]
    admin: [admin-console-hostname]
    adminUrl: [admin-console-base-url]
    strict: [true|false]
    strictBackchannel: [true|false]
```

== Some fields are no longer required

The `hostname` and `tlsSecret` fields are now optional to align with the Quarkus distribution configuration. With that we also removed the possibility to set `INSECURE-DISABLE` special value to those fields. In order to disable hostname checks and enable HTTP, please follow the same approach as with the Quarkus distribution, i.e. set `strict: false`, `strictBackchannel: false` and `httpEnabled: true` fields.


= OLM channel was changed to fast

The default channel of Keycloak Operator Lifecycle Manager was changed to `fast`.
