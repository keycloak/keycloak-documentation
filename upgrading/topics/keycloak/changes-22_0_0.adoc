= Change of the default Client ID mapper of Service Account Client

Default `Client ID` mapper of `Service Account Client` has been changed. `Token Claim Name` field value has been changed from `clientId` to `client_id`.
`client_id` claim is compliant with OAuth2 specifications:

- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068#section-2.2[JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens]
- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7662#section-2.2[OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection]
- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693#section-4.3[OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange]

`clientId` userSession note still exists.
