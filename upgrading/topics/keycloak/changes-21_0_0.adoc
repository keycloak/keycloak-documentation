= Keycloak uses Micrometer for metrics

Keycloak provides an optional a metrics endpoint which exports metrics in the Prometheus format.
In this release the implementation to provide this data switched from SmallRye to Micrometer, which is the https://quarkus.io/guides/micrometer[recommended metrics library for Quarkus].

Due to this change, metrics have been renamed.
The following table shows some examples.

Before upgrading it is recommended to review all metrics returned from the endpoint before and after the change, and update their usage in dashboards and alerts.

= Deprecated RSA_SHA1 and DSA_SHA1 algorithms for SAML

Algorithms `RSA_SHA1` and `DSA_SHA1`, which can be configured as `Signature algorithms` on SAML adapters, clients and identity providers are deprecated. It is recommended to use safer
alternatives based on `SHA256` or `SHA512`. Other reason is, that verifying signatures on signed SAML documents or assertions with these
algorithms does not work on Java 17 or later. So in case that you use this algorithm and the other party consuming your SAML documents is running on Java 17 or later, verifying signatures will not work.

The possible workaround is to remove algorithms like `http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1` or `http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa-sha1` from the list
of "disallowed algorithms" configured on property `jdk.xml.dsig.secureValidationPolicy` in the file `$JAVA_HOME/conf/security/java.security`.
