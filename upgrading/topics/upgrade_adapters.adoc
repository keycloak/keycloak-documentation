[[_upgrade_adapters]]

It is important that you upgrade {project_name} server first, and then upgrade the adapters. Earlier versions of the
adapter might work with later versions of {project_name} server, but earlier versions of {project_name} server might not
work with later versions of the adapter.

[[_compatibility_with_older_adapters]]
== Compatibility with older adapters

As mentioned above, we try to support newer release versions of {project_name} server working with older release versions of the adapters.
However, in some cases we need to include fixes on the {project_name} server side which may break compatibility with older versions
of the adapters. For example, when we implement new aspects of the OpenID Connect specification, which older client adapter versions
were not aware of.

In those cases, we added Compatibility modes. For OpenId Connect clients, there is a section named `OpenID Connect Compatibility Modes`
in the {project_name} admin console, on the page with client details. Here, you can disable some new aspects of the {project_name} server
to preserve compatibility with older client adapters. More details are available in the tool tips of individual switches.
